<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Meow: A Book of Happiness for Cat Lovers (Animal Happiness)</h2><p>Cats have a way of walking into our lives and making themselves right at home. No cat lover can imagine life without a feline presence &#x2014; even if it is only as fleeting as the occasional conversation with a neighbourhood stray. For all those who have succumbed to the charm of the cat comes the third edition of <i>Meow: A book of happiness for cat lovers</i>. A compendium of delightful and sometimes hilarious quotes captures the essence of this fascination. Some are by famous people (Mark Twain, Jean Cocteau, Ernest Hemingway) and others are philosophical, or light-hearted &#x2014; all are memorable. Accompanied by beautiful and heart-warming photography, this classic bestseller is now pouncing back into hard-back in a high-quality gift format for a collection to truly treasure. The result is a book to be enjoyed, savoured and dipped into again and again.</p><p><p><b>Anouska Jones</b> is a book editor, publisher, reviewer and author, who has worked in publishing for over twenty years.

However, the original volume, filled with practical advice for sober living, was written by two anonymous men who, presumably, considered their audience to be comprised predominantly, if not entirely, of men. That's why Hazelden's new edition is written expressly for women. It features the original text of <i>The Little Red Book </i>along with annotated passages addressing issues related to how women experience addiction and recovery. The annotations, written by best-selling author Karen Casey, introduce women to the extraordinary camaraderie of Alcoholics Anonymous and the restorative powers of Twelve Step recovery.<br> <br>We hope <i>The Little Red Book for Women</i> opens new avenues of thought and helps the AA member arrive at his or her successful interpretation of the program.<br> <br><i>The Little Red Book for Women</i> makes frequent reference to basic matter in <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, fourth edition.</p><p>Two anonymous men wrote the original Little Red Book. The best-selling book was created to provide guidance to both newcomers to AA and those who were trying to teach them about the fundamentals of the 12 Step program of recovery. This new version for women was annotated by Karen Casey, best-selling author of Each Day a New Beginning.Since 1946, The Little Red Book has served as a guidepost for participants in Alcoholics Anonymous. Revising that book's often male-directed advice, this new edition is written specifically for women going through the recovery process. Descriptions of the famous 12 steps make up the bulk of the book, and while the steps themselves are not rewritten for this publication, the analysis and discussion surrounding each step is geared toward women. Designed to be studied repeatedly, the pocket-sized guide is always reassuring and brims with advice on overcoming addiction. Notes in the margins speak to women readers, giving additional guidance on seeking female sponsors, relieving guilt, getting over the need to be perfect, dealing with low self-esteem, engaging in relaxing activities (like exercise and meditation) and maintaining a healthy balance between what others need and personal needs. A Q&amp;A section and suggestions for further reading (including Alcoholics Anonymous, Fourth Edition; and Stools and Bottles) round out this encouraging book. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Visiting dozens of towns, the America they saw is acutely conscious of its problems&#x2014;from economic dislocation to the opioid scourge&#x2014;but it is also crafting solutions, with a practical-minded determination at dramatic odds with the bitter paralysis of national politics. At times of dysfunction on a national level, reform possibilities have often arisen from the local level. The Fallowses describe America in the middle of one of these creative waves. Their view of the country is as complex and contradictory as America itself, but it also reflects the energy, the generosity and compassion, the dreams, and the determination of many who are in the midst of making things better. <i>Our Towns</i> is the story of their journey&#x2014;and an account of a country busy remaking itself.</p><p><b>JAMES FALLOWS</b> has been a national correspondent for <i>The Atlantic </i>for more than thirty-five years, reporting from China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and across the United States. He is the author of eleven previous books. His work has also appeared in many other magazines and as public-radio commentaries since the 1980s. He has won a National Book Award and a National Magazine Award. For two years he was President Jimmy Carter&#x2019;s chief speechwriter.<br><br><b>DEBORAH FALLOWS</b> is a linguist and writer who holds a PhD in theoretical linguistics and is the author of two previous books.

Montgomery.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Deborah Fallows</b><br>And with that, we were off, flying away from frigid Washington, D.C., and its political postelection turmoil, on a southerly route to California.<br><br>We had flown nearly one hundred thousand miles in nearly four years in our small plane, with Jim as pilot and me in the right seat. We began in my home territory of the Upper Midwest, then headed over to Maine and flew south through New England and the Mid-Atlantic states to Georgia and Florida. We swept farther through the Deep South, to Texas and the Southwest, up the Central Valley of California to Oregon and Washington, and closed the loop after leaving Montana. All the while we snaked in and out of the so-called flyover country, through Wyoming, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and much more.<br><br>We have landed in dozens of towns and cities along the way, anticipating in each of them local stories that would organize themselves into some kind of composed narrative about the backbone and character of the region and maybe beyond that, to help explain the character of the country. We began by looking for towns with positive energy, with signs of rebound from some kind of shock or shift, like a mine or factory that had closed or waves of people who&#x2019;d departed or newcomers who&#x2019;d arrived. We ended up adding towns with down-and-out reputations where we truly feared for what we might find. Life upon landing was never quite what we&#x2019;d planned.<br><br>We have stayed in towns for weeks at a time. We have often revisited them, following threads from one person, or one group or town institution or movement, to the next, settling into the local rhythm. We have gone to town plays and musicals, sat in on civic meetings, hung out at coffee shops and brewpubs, spent days at schools, libraries, and ball games, taken tours of downtowns, visited factories, start-ups, and community college classes, taken boat rides and bike rides, swum in local public pools and run on high school tracks, borrowed cars, and stayed in motels, private homes, and one-off eco-hotels. We remained long enough to begin to imagine how much we didn&#x2019;t know, but also to appreciate the unusual opportunity we&#x2019;ve had, in seeing a broader sampling of modern America&#x2019;s realities than most of its citizens will ever have a chance to do. ...<br>&nbsp;<br>*<br><br>I&#x2019;m not a pilot, which is often an uncomfortable admission. I don&#x2019;t share the zealous passion for flying that I have seen in most pilots, and my eyesight has always been, well, wanting. If Jim says, &#x201c;Do you see the runway?,&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll mumble something in return. But after a thousand hours of being in the right seat, I know a lot about flying the plane. I know its repertoire of gurgles and agitations as well as I knew those of our infant children. I am very familiar with the gauges, navigation, radio work with ATC, steering the plane, and I know how to pull the parachute, which deploys from the fuselage and settles the plane in a true emergency. The parachute of the Cirrus, now the best-selling small aircraft in the world, eliminates night-before-flight worries for me.<br>&nbsp;<br>We stopped in Las Cruces in search of cheap fuel and a late-afternoon lunch. We never knew what kind of food we would find. Many times, vending-machine peanut butter crackers were the best we could do. I worried about this a lot in our early days. Our go-to provisions were a cool sack with dried fruit, nuts, granola bars, carrots, hummus, grapes, cheese, Vitaminwater&#x2014;you get the picture. Over time, the list became leaner and leaner. By now, more than three years later, we&#x2019;d actually become aficionados of jerky: beef, buffalo, reindeer, elk, spicy, lime- ginger, teriyaki. One Uber driver who drove us on an unscheduled stop in Wyoming went on for twenty minutes with stories about his homemade jerky from a personal drying machine. When lunch in Las Cruces didn&#x2019;t work out, jerky it was.<br><br>We pressed on for another hour or so to Tucson. The mountains deflated into undulating brown hills. We flew over flatlands with occasional volcanic outcroppings and long stretches of almost surreal desert landscapes that looked like pointillist paintings...<br><br>As we flew over Palm Springs, the aerial road signs were becoming familiar: the mountains north and south, the desert settlements below, the wind farms, the Banning Pass through to the Los Angeles basin. We flew over Redlands, our destination, to San Bernardino and the long, wide runways that had once accommodated B-52s when this site was Norton Air Force Base. Jim guided our Cirrus in, hovering near touchdown in the wind gusts for the final few hundred feet.<br><br>*<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Landed</b>. What were we supposed to feel now, some twenty-five hundred miles and four days later? Or one hundred thousand miles and four years later? Maybe like Mark Twain, I thought, one of the writers whose account of an epic journey I had read. At the end of twenty days by stagecoach, the Washoe Zephyr, from Missouri to the territory of Nevada, Twain wrote, &#x201c;It had been a fine pleasure trip; we had fed fat on wonders every day; we were now well accustomed to stage life, and very fond of it; so the idea of coming to a stand-still in a village was not agreeable, but on the contrary depressing.&#x201d;<br><br>We, too, had indeed &#x201c;fed fat on wonders every day.&#x201d; Our ending didn&#x2019;t feel as sad as Twain described his, but he was young then and didn&#x2019;t understand yet that you can craft many adventures in a lifetime. I knew we would head on to many more adventures, and that this ending was, again, another beginning.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><b>###</b> &nbsp;<br><br><i>Charleston, WV</i><br><br> <b>James Fallows</b><br><i>Mountain Stage</i> is the main national-media production coming out of West Virginia, and it has been a significant force in country music. It was carried by 150 stations nationwide at the time of our visit, and in the next two years it expanded to 200. The list of artists who had their first live-broadcast exposure to a national audience under host Larry Groce&#x2019;s auspices is so long and impressive that at first I didn&#x2019;t really believe it (but then I checked it out). <br><br>We got to see a live Mountain Stage performance at the Civic Center in downtown Charleston, before an enthusiastic and youngish full-house crowd.<br><br>A few days after the show, we went to see Groce and his family at their house, both to ask him about the program&#x2019;s history but also because his name frequently came up when we asked people in Charleston, &#x201c;Who makes this town go?&#x201d;<br><br>West Virginia in general and the Kanawha Valley region around Charleston are, of course, places where not enough has gone right for quite a long time. The coal industry has inevitably shrunk and is shrinking further; the big processing works that once gave the area the name &#x201c;Chemical Valley&#x201d; are mainly gone.<br><br>So what was it like to run a recording career from here? And to produce a national radio show from a state usually the object of condescension from coastal big-city tastemakers? Two themes ran through what Groce told us.<br><br>One was about the possibilities and challenges of doing first-tier creative work in what the world considers second- or third-tier locations. This, obviously, was a major theme through all of our travels. Whether they come out and say it or not, many of the country&#x2019;s most ambitious people assume that work of a certain level requires being in a certain place. <br><br>This idea of a vast national sorting system for talent has huge ramifications. They range from politics to the distortion of real estate prices in a handful of coastal big cities. But as we continued to find, in countless other places across the country, people don&#x2019;t have to start out assuming that most of what they take home will immediately go out for the rent or mortgage. This is because they have calculated that&#x2014;in Duluth and Greenville or any of dozens of other places, they can build their company, pursue their ambition, and realize their dream without crowding into the biggest cities.<br><br>As for Larry Groce, when he first got to West Virginia, he said he found it comfortable, because &#x201c;the way people here looked, acted, and even sounded&#x201d; reminded him of his grandparents&#x2019; and great-aunts&#x2019; generation in Texas. Which made sense, since many Texans of that era had migrated from Appalachia. As he stayed, he came to appreciate its practicality, its lack of pretension, and its person-to-person level of generosity.<br><br> <i>Practicality</i>: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of those places that has never had a boom, so booms and busts are relative. If you&#x2019;re never up, you can&#x2019;t be down.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Lack of pretension</i>: &#x201c;Lots of people can make an album in the studio who can&#x2019;t do it live.&#x201d; (<i>Mountain Stage</i> is recorded before a live audience.) &#x201c;That is very West Virginia, too: to deliver in person. We have hillbillies, but we&#x2019;ll tell you what a hillbilly is&#x2014;you [outsiders] don&#x2019;t tell us.&#x201d; This was two years before J. D. Vance&#x2019;s book Hillbilly Elegy made the term a staple of political conversation. &#x201c;A hillbilly isn&#x2019;t an ignorant fool. He&#x2019;s a straightforward, self-effacing, &#x2018;what you see is what you get&#x2019; person. He relies on his friends because he doesn&#x2019;t trust a lot of other things. He is not necessarily formally educated. But he is smart.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Generosity</i>: &#x201c;If your car gets broken down, you want it to happen in West Virginia. This whole stuff about <i>Deliverance</i>, it&#x2019;s just the opposite. If something happens, you want it to happen here. People will stop and help.&#x201d; <br><br>Groce told the story of a national network correspondent who came to interview people nearby and found them unwilling to answer questions. So he put up the hood of his car as if he were having engine trouble, and people came over to help him out and talk with him.<br><br>Groce seemed content with and proud of his show and its cultural reach, but he was fully aware that &#x201c;since it is a national show, we have felt stereotypes people have about West Virginia.&#x201d;<br><br>He said, &#x201c;One thing I&#x2019;ve learned over the years, when you put &#x2018;Mountain&#x2019; in the title of something, people think you&#x2019;re the fiddle-and-banjo show. Which we&#x2019;re not. Of course, if we were just an old-timey bluegrass country show, we&#x2019;d probably get more national press, since we&#x2019;d fit expectations.<br><br>&#x201c;We see the expectations in the stories that are generated about this place. Have a mine disaster?<br>The reporters are all here. Have a chemical spill? All here. Have something where it shows that some percentage of the children are poor or obese? Yes. But if you have Gabriel Kahane and Kate Miller-Heidke on one show, and then James McMurtry, it doesn&#x2019;t fit the categories, doesn&#x2019;t make sense.&#x201d;<br><br>If I am making Groce sound defensive in recounting this, I&#x2019;m misrepresenting him. His tone was like that of a politician who understands, anthropologist-style, that the press simply can&#x2019;t help concentrating on elections rather than governing but nonetheless realizes that his or her job comes down to governing.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the second theme Larry Groce reminded us of, beyond his insistence on the potential for the first-rate from this locale? His sense that West Virginia and Charleston, for all their travails, were moving in the right, rather than the wrong, direction.<br><br>&#x201c;Lots of people who are older are looking backward,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;people can get stuck in &#x2018;I remember when. . . .&#x2019; Coal is dying, but it&#x2019;s like a dangerous animal that&#x2019;s dying. It&#x2019;s going to thrash.&#x201d;<br><br>However, he said, younger people, as well as those from elsewhere, didn&#x2019;t have that memory. They were starting new businesses and families and projects. &#x201c;I think in the last ten years there has been a renaissance,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to go to a place because the money is good. It&#x2019;s different because you like being there. I am optimistic about this place.&#x201d;</p><h2>Battle Chasers Anthology</h2><p>Collecting every issue ever published of one of the most beloved comic book series of all time, this oversized graphic novel is bursting at the seams with adventure!

This third edition improves <i>Tea</i> with this revised and extended content plus new photographs. </p><p> <i>TeaTime Magazine</i> called <i>Tea</i> "the reference work we've been waiting for", noting its value to students. </p><p> <i>Library Journal</i> praised <i>Tea</i> as a "definitive guide to tea (that) will appeal to die-hard tea enthusiasts." </p><p> <i>Tea House Times</i> found <i>Tea</i> "impressive, well researched, and complete." </p><p> <i>Tea</i> takes readers on an escorted tour of the world's tea-growing countries -- China, Japan, Taiwan, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Vietnam and East Africa -- where they will discover how, like a fine wine, it is "terroir" (soil and climate) that gives a tea its unique characteristics. </p><p> The authors own the popular Camellia Sinensis Tea House in Montreal which imports teas directly from producers in these countries. Each author focuses on specific tea regions where they travel every year to work with growers and producers, discover new teas and keep abreast of developments that might, for example, remove a tea from the tea house's menu. </p><p> The book covers black, green, white, yellow, oolong, pu'er, perfumed, aromatic and smoked teas and includes:</p><ul> <li> An overview of the history of tea </li> <li> Tea families, varieties, cultivars and grades </li> <li> How tea is grown, harvested and processed </li> <li> The tea trade worldwide </li> <li> Profile interviews with tea industry personalities. </li></ul> <p></p><p> Special features that loyal tea drinkers will especially enjoy are: </p><ul> <li> Local tastes and methods of preparing tea (e.g. macha) </li> <li> Tasting notes and infusion accessories </li> <li> Teapot recommendations </li> <li> Caffeine, antioxidant and biochemical properties of 35 teas </li> <li> 15 gourmet recipes using tea</li> <li> A directory of 42 select teas.</li></ul> <p></p></p><p><p> Kevin Gascoyne, Fran�ois Marchand, Jasmin Desharnais and Hugo Am�rici are professional tea tasters and the owners of Camellia Sinensis Tea House in Montreal, Quebec. </p><p> Foreword </p><p> Tea is the ultimate universal beverage. Whether in a Mongolian yurt, a Berber encampment in the middle of the Sahara, a house in Azerbaijan, admiring a verdant Irish landscape or in the heart of the mountains of New Zealand, it is tea that warms us when we are cold and cools us when we are hot. It welcomes the arriving guest and is a promise from the departing guest to return. From China, where it originated, tea has crossed all the borders of the world. It is known and respected for its virtues and appreciated for its taste. </p><p> Celebrated by poets and adored by emperors, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world today and forms an integral part of the diet of millions at all levels of society. With its history that spans several millennia, a wealth of cultures that have influenced it and traditions that have raised it to its noble stature, the world of tea is so vast that it can never be completely known. </p><p> Whether it comes from the precious first harvests of spring, the sacred mountains of China or the highest gardens of Darjeeling, every cup of tea tells a story, reveals knowledge and conjures up a landscape. If we add in the expertise of master craftspeople who have passed on these traditions over several centuries we have a vast diversity of unique and exotic products. </p><p> For many years now, our approach as tasters and importers has led us to discover the terroirs of tea, the way in which it is grown and processed, the role each plays within its own culture and the economy of the country where it is produced, the evolution of the rituals that accompany its serving, and the reasons it came to be considered such a noble beverage. These discoveries have enriched our enjoyment of tea as well as our knowledge of it. This book reflects a progression that we hope will accompany you on your future taste travels. </p><p> What we offer you here is naturally a Western approach to tea, but we attribute as much importance to the plant and the places where it grows as to the master producers who devote their lives to its cultivation. For we must not forget that, just like wine, tea represents one of humanity's most fabulous achievements, using precious knowledge inherited over generations and taking advantage of the most distinct properties of its specific growing environment. </p><p> -- Hugo, Jasmin, Fran�ois, Kevin and the team at Camellia Sinensis Tea House </p></p><h2>The pH Miracle for Weight Loss</h2><p>- Dr. Young's most recent book, The pH Miracle for Diabetes (Warner, 0-446-53266-5, 7/04), has grossed over 30,000 hardcover copies to date.

Young, Ph.D., is a nationally renowned microbiologist and nutritionist. He is the head of The pH Miracle Foundation. A member of the American Society of Microbiologists and the American Naturopathic Association, he speaks around the world on wellness issues, including diabetes, cancer, leukemia, and AIDS, as well as nutrition and general health and fitness.</p><p>Building on the success of their first book, the best-selling <i>The pH Miracle</i>, in this book Dr. Young and his wife turn their attention to what is considered by many health experts as America&#x2019;s number one health crisis&#x2014;the growing numbers of people who are seriously overweight or obese. Contrary to other popular weight loss books, most notably those, such as <i>The Atkins&#x2019; Diet</i> and <i>The South Beach Diet</i>, that tout a low-carbohydrate approach to achieving weight loss, the Youngs maintain that the primary culprit behind excessive weight gain, as well as many other health problems, is a chronic state of acidity in the body (a pH value below 7.1). Shifting the body&#x2019;s chemistry to a more alkaline pH, they maintain, will quickly and easily result in the loss of excess weight and the buildup of more lean muscle tissue. <p> The goal outlined by the Youngs in this book is to replace dieting with a 12-week, seven-step program that is intended to not only rejuvenate the entire body by replacing current blood cells with blood cells "at the peak of health," but also to create an ongoing lifestyle that will permanently keep off the pounds that were shed during the 12-week period. In addition to a rich section on eating tips to create more alkalinity in the body (complete with an extensive list of recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus), the book also covers the importance of adequate water drinking, proper exercise, important nutritional supplements, learning how to manage thoughts and emotions that can contribute to acidity, goal-setting, and, for optimum results, a two-week cleansing program. In support of the program, the book also includes a collection of testimonials from people who have achieved significant weight loss on the program&#x2014;further backed up by before-and-after photographs. With an increasing number of health professionals now emphasizing the importance of proper pH to overall health, the information this book presents is both timely and fairly easy to implement. <i>Larry Trivieri Jr.</i></p>AUTHORBIO: ROBERT O.

He's good at errands. Today, even though it was really warm, the Pain was wearing earmuffs. Big fluffy ones. Our first stop was the shoe store. The shoe salesman took one look at the Pain and said, "We have some nice snow boots on sale. Half price."<br> "Why would I want snow boots in May?" the Pain asked.<br> The shoe man shrugged. "Looks like you're getting ready for winter," he said, pointing to the Pain's earmuffs.<br> "I'm getting ready for&nbsp;a haircut," the Pain told him.<br> "Oh," the shoe salesman said, as if that made perfect sense.<br> The Pain got a pair of sandals. So did I.<br> From the shoe store the three of us walked up the street to Mr. Soupy's. Mr. Soupy is our haircutter. You have to be under twelve to have Mr. Soupy cut your hair. In the window of his shop there's a sign. It says Mr. Soupy sings while he snips your hair. "No more than an inch," I reminded him when it was my turn.<br> "A big inch or a little inch?" Mr. Soupy sang.<br> "A little inch," I said.<br> I knew when Mr. Soupy was done because he whipped off my cape and shook out the hair. I watched as it floated to the floor. It looked like more than an inch to me.<br> Then it was the Pain's turn. But he was still outside. He looked over at Dad. Dad was in the waiting area, reading a magazine. Then the Pain looked at me.<br> "What?" I said, even though I knew what. The Pain is scared of haircuts. He didn't used to be scared. Nobody knows why he's suddenly weird about them. Maybe he knows. But if he&nbsp;does, he's not telling.<br> Finally, he climbed up into the chair.<br> "Hmmm . . ." Mr. Soupy said, walking around him. "It's hard to give a good haircut when a person is wearing earmuffs."<br> The Pain just sat in the chair pretending he couldn't hear a word. I lifted one of his earmuffs halfway off and talked right into his ear. "Mr. Soupy says he can't give you a good haircut while you're wearing earmuffs."<br> As soon as I said it I started wondering if Mr. Soupy is his real name. Probably not. It's probably just&nbsp;some name he invented. If it is his real name I wonder if it's his first name or last? Probably his last. I wonder what his first name is? Sam Soupy? Scott Soupy? Zachariah Soupy?<br> Mr. Soupy tried to get the Pain to take off his earmuffs. He made silly faces. He did a wild dance. But he wasn't getting anywhere. The Pain just sat there.<br> Finally, I said, "Why don't you try it with just one ear covered? That way, if Mr. Soupy doesn't cut off your first ear you'll know you're safe."<br> The Pain didn't answer.<br> "Look around," I told him. "Do you see anyone without two ears?"<br> The Pain looked at the kids who were waiting.<br> They looked back at him.<br> "That doesn't mean it can't happen," he said. "Besides, if Mr. Soupy cut off your ear would you come back?"<br> "The only&nbsp;cut you get at my shop is a haircut!" Mr. Soupy sang. Then he laughed at his own joke.<br> I laughed with him.<br> But the Pain didn't even smile.<br> "You can cut the back," the Pain told Mr. Soupy. "You can cut the front. But you can't cut around my ears. Those&nbsp;are the rules."<br> "Okay," Mr. Soupy said. "No problem."<br> "You can do that?" the Pain asked.<br> "Sure."<br> "Won't he look funny?" I said.<br> "Sure," Mr. Soupy said. "But he didn't say he cared about looking funny."<br> Mr. Soupy raised his scissors to the Pain's head. As soon as he did, the Pain let out a wail. . . . "Waaahhhh!!!"<br> That got Dad's attention. He came over to the chair. "What's up?" Dad asked.<br> Mr. Soupy put down his scissors and said, "I give up!"<br> "You can't give up," Dad said. "You're Mr. Soupy. You get the job done!"<br> Mr. Soupy sighed. "Bring him back in a few days," he told Dad.

In response to extraordinary events, Franz tells a unique account of the decision-making sessions of this religion&#x2019;s inner council and the powerful, sometimes dramatic, impact their decisions have on Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses. Crisis of Conscience offers a penetrating view of the supreme council of this organization, the Governing Body and their life altering power over human lives. <br> While the events of Raymond Franz's departure from the Governing Body occurred in 1980, the organizational foundation and structure remains the same today, making this account relevant to a whole new generation. <br> Content: Raymond Franz, formerly a Governing Body member of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, shares an account that reveals the inner workings and the decision-making processes of that Body, offering a penetrating view of the life altering power they have over human lives. The final nine of his sixty years as one of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses were spent on this central executive council. Those years led to his crisis of conscience, which is the theme of this book. <br> Based on the entire manuscript of Franz&#x2019;s 2008 printing of Crisis of Conscience, this fifth edition 2018, also includes: <br> �Foreword by David Henke, author of Spiritual Abuse Recovery Workbook, and founder of Watchmen Fellowship, Inc. &#x2014; David Henke is a Christian apologist that specializes in the field of Jehovah's Witnesses, issues of mind control, spiritual abuse, and legalism. In addition to the above workbook, Henke has authored evangelistic and educational tracts, and articles. <br> �Excerpts from Franz&#x2019;s In Search of Christian Freedom &#x2014; Crisis of Conscience references 30 pages from In Search of Christian Freedom in the footnotes; for the convenience of the reader, these pages have been added to Appendix B. <br> �Where is the &#x201c;Great Crowd&#x201d; Serving God? by Jon A. Mitchell, a former secretary to the Governing Body &#x2014; As a secretary to the Governing Body, and member of the Service Department, Mitchell observed events during and immediately after Raymond Franz&#x2019; resignation from the Governing Body and numerous people were moved, demoted or disfellowshipped. As a result Jon Mitchell authored a booklet called Where is The &#x201c;Great Crowd&#x201d; Serving God? This is an account of Jon&#x2019;s observations and his personal research from 1980 to 1981 while serving at Brooklyn Bethel. This booklet has been included in its entirety in Appendix C. <br> �Epilogue, The Copyright Owner&#x2019;s Story by Deborah Dykstra &#x2014; Former regular pioneer and temporary special pioneer, Deborah Dykstra tells her journey of discovering that Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses were not the sound foundation that she thought they were, realizing instead that it is Jesus Christ himself that is the real &#x201c;truth&#x201d; and foundation to life as a Christian. Thereafter, she shares how she embarked on a 25 year friendship with Raymond and Cynthia Franz along with anecdotal stories about the Franz&#x2019; lives. <br> Raymond Franz died in 2010, however in this re-publishing of Crisis of Conscience based on it&#x2019;s very last printing in 2008, the authors story, heart and expressions of his love for God and his fellow man remain with us.</p><p>Raymond Franz, formerly a Governing Body member of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, was part of the third-generation in his family to join the Watch Tower Society, serving in various countries at nearly every level of the organizational structure. Graduating from Gilead missionary school of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses in 1944, Franz served in Puerto Rico, the British Virgin Islands, and the Dominican Republic until he was reassigned to Brooklyn headquarters in 1965. Thereafter as part of the headquarters staff, he worked in the writing department. By 1971 he was invited to become a Governing Body member, serving as such until resigning in 1980. Franz shares an account that reveals the inner workings and the decision-making processes of the Governing Body. The final nine of his sixty years as one of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses were spent on this central executive council. Those years led to his crisis of conscience, which is the theme of this book.<p>&#x201c;The book goes far beyond recounting Franz&#x2019;s personal crisis. It describes the much larger crisis that faces Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses worldwide.&#x201d;</p><p><strong>&#x2014; Christianity Toda</strong>y</p><p>&#x201c;A candid and uniquely informative view of the authority structure and inner workings of the religious organization known as Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses.</p><p>&#x201c;... the book is a poignant personal document, reaffirming the value of &#x2018;freedom of conscience,&#x2019; and inviting renewed attention to the classic problem of how this value is to be kept alive in the face of the perennial resurgence of bureaucratic and authoritarian structures.&#x201d;</p><p><strong>&#x2014; Dr. Joseph F. Zygmunt, Associate Professor, Department of Sociology, University of Connecticut</strong></p><p>&#x201c;In past years, much literature (about Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses) of varying quality has been published ... with certain exceptions, it has been poor when judged from critical scholarly criteria ... A well-documented work on the controversial movement has finally become available to the Witnesses and the public in general ... No serious scholar or reader, therefore, can now ignore the information presented by Raymond Franz.</p><p>&#x201c;A common fault with authors who feel they have to disclose errors&#x2014;real or imagined&#x2014;within a movement they later have been forced to break with, are feelings of hatred and bitterness. You will find little of this in Crisis of Conscience. To the contrary, the calm, objective tone awakens respect and admiration.&#x201d;</p><p><strong>&#x2014; Dr. Ingemar Linden, Th.D., Dagen, Stockholm, Sweden</strong></p></p><h2>Sleep (Baby Faces)</h2><p><b>The perfect bedtime book and an ideal first read-aloud book, this new addition to the popular Baby Faces series, has appealing photos of multicultural babies and toddlers, and a brief, rhyming text.</b><br><br>Babies are mesmerized by other babies -- and the strikingly candid photos in SLEEP will keep little ones spellbound.

If you enjoy books about near-death experiences, such as those by Raymond Moody, Jeffrey Long, and James Van Praagh; watch televisions shows like <em>Ghosthunters, Touched by an Angel</em>, and <em>Ghost Whisperer</em>; or are interested in works that explore the intersection of faith and science, such as <em>Spiritual Brain, Signature in the Cell</em>, and <em>When Science Meets Religion</em>; you&#x2019;ll find much to ponder in <em>Consciousness Beyond Life</em>.</p></p><p><p>As a cardiologist, Pim van Lommel was struck by the number of his patients who claimed to have near-death experiences as a result of their heart attacks. As a scientist, this was difficult for him to accept: Wouldn't it be scientifically irresponsible of him to ignore the evidence of these stories? Faced with this dilemma, van Lommel decided to design a research study to investigate the phenomenon under the controlled environment of a cluster of hospitals with a medically trained staff. </p><p>For more than twenty years van Lommel systematically studied such near-death experiences in a wide variety of hospital patients who survived a cardiac arrest. In 2001, he and his fellow researchers published his study on near-death experiences in the renowned medical journal <em>The Lancet</em>. The article caused an international sensation as it was the first scientifically rigorous study of this phenomenon. Now available for the first time in English, van Lommel offers an in-depth presentation of his results and theories in this book that has already sold over 125,000 copies in Europe.</p><p>Van Lommel provides scientific evidence that the near-death phenomenon is an authentic experience that cannot be attributed to imagination, psychosis, or oxygen deprivation. He further reveals that after such a profound experience, most patients' personalities undergo a permanent change. In van Lommel's opinion, the current views on the relationship between the brain and consciousness held by most physicians, philosophers, and psychologists are too narrow for a proper understanding of the phenomenon. In <em>Consciousness Beyond Life</em>, van Lommel shows that our consciousness does not always coincide with brain functions and that, remarkably and significantly, consciousness can even be experienced separate from the body.</p><p>Pim van Lommel is a world-renowned cardiologist and medical expert on near-death experiences. For more than twenty-five years he worked as a cardiologist at an eight-hundred-bed teaching hospital in the Netherlands where he began studying near-death experiences in patients who survived a cardiac arrest. In addition to his sensational study published in the distinguished British medical journal <em>The Lancet</em>, van Lommel has authored chapters in several books about near-death experiences and also published many articles about the subject. Over the past several years, van Lommel has been lecturing all over the world on near-death experiences and the relationship between consciousness and brain function. In 2005, he was granted the Bruce Greyson Research Award on behalf of the International Association of Near-Death Studies. In 2006, the president of India awarded him the lifetime achievement award at the World Congress on Clinical and Preventive Cardiology in New Delhi. </p></p><h2>One Piece, Vol. 33 (33)</h2><p>High jinx on the high seas!<br><br>Please note: book reads right to left (Japanese style)<br><br>As a child, Monkey D.

After turning his profoundly messed-up early life and its alcoholic aftermath into six harrowing, uplifting memoirs--including <em>Running with Scissors</em> and <em>Dry</em>--Burroughs lost interest in writing about himself. He kept meeting people who were locked in the same struggles he&#x2019;d overcome and decided they needed to know they had options for fixing their lives. In <em>This Is How</em>, Burroughs delivers prescriptions for handling life's most pernicious problems. Don't let the snake-oil-salesmannish title put you off: this is raw, hard-knock-life advice, veering from brutal to hilarious to deeply compassionate. Burroughs doesn&#x2019;t really believe in "happiness" or "healing." He&#x2019;s honest about the limits of recovery, but even those in the depths of despair will be energized by his exhortations to claw their way back to OK, even if it means leaving the life they&#x2019;ve known in the dust. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em><p>AUGUSTEN BURROUGHS is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A Wolf At The</i> <i>Table</i>, <i>Possible Side Effects, You Better Not Cry, Magical Thinking</i>, <i>Dry</i>, <i>Running with Scissors</i>, and <i>Sellevision</i>.

The day you asked Jesus into your heart.<br><br>Church was a huge part of my life growing up. At home, my parents taught me the importance of faith in Jesus and studied Scripture with me. In fact, one of the first Bible verses I memorized was John 3:16: &#x201c;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only&nbsp;begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.&#x201d;<br><br>This verse is the foundation of what it means to be a Christian. Maybe you&#x2019;ve heard or read this verse hundreds of times. Maybe, like me, it&#x2019;s one of the first verses you memorized. Before you understand who you are, you have to know whose you are.<br><br>Let me break down this verse for you:&nbsp;<br>For God so loved the world. The world is not just every single one of the billions of people on this planet, but you! God so loved_________________________ (write in your name here).<br><br>That He gave His only begotten Son. God loves you so much that He was willing to give up His own child for you.<br><br>That whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. You can live with God forever. All you have to do to be saved is to believe in Jesus (see Romans 10:9). This is what He wants for you. He loves you so much that He wants you to be a part of eternal life with Him!<br><br>I love these words because they&#x2019;re simple, clear, and packed with meaning.<br><br>I remember waking up one morning when I was six years old. Living on a forty-four-acre farm, my two brothers, two sisters, and I had a long chore list. There was always something to do. Mow lawns. Chase cows into the field. Lift hay bales. Chop wood. Weed the garden. That morning, before I set out to do my chores and while Dad was running the tractor, I told my mom I wanted to ask Jesus into my heart. It was the most important day of my life. In fact, my&nbsp;parents were so thrilled, we celebrated by eating dinner that night at one of the largest McDonald&#x2019;s in the world. (Though even at six, I should have known better than to chow down a Big Mac.) The next day, the festivities continued at Epcot.&nbsp;<br><br>So who are you? The dictionary defines identity as &#x201c;who someone is, the name of a person, the qualities, beliefs, etc., that make a particular person or group different from others.&#x201d; I like to say that identity comes not necessarily from who we are but from whose we are.<br><br>If you believe in Jesus, you are a son or daughter of God. You are the object of His love. He has a plan and a purpose for your life (see Jeremiah 29:11). And He will never, ever leave or forsake you (see Hebrews 13:5).<br><b>IN YOUR OWN WORDS</b><br><br>1. Finish this thought: I am . . . (a child of God, loved, made with a purpose, and so on).<br>2. Describe your spiritual birthday. Where were you when you asked Jesus into your heart? Who was with you?<br>3. If you have never asked Jesus into your heart, I want to encourage you to do it right now with your mom or your dad. You can use your own words or read mine below: Dear Jesus, I know I am a sinner and need a Savior. Thank You that You died for me and rose again. I open the door of my heart and ask You to come in. Thank You for coming into my heart and forgiving my sins. Thank You that God is my Father and I am His child. Thank You that I have a home in heaven and that I will come and live with You someday. In Your name, amen.<br><b>SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT</b><br><br>Jesus didn&#x2019;t save you because you&#x2019;re awesome: He saved you because He&#x2019;s awesome.</p><h2>Wills, Trusts, and Estates (Examples &amp; Explanations)</h2><p><p>A favorite classroom prep tool of successful students that is often recommended by professors, the <strong>Examples &amp; Explanations </strong>(E&amp;E) series provides an alternative perspective to help you understand your casebook and in-class lectures.

So he joins as a drummer boy, instead. Part of Willie's job is rousing the troops in the morning with his drum&#x2014;the other part is being the last to retreat in battles. In this true story, Willie shows he's brave enough to keep beating his drum, but will he be lucky enough to survive the war?<br><br>"Scrupulously researched and overflowing with evocative detail . . . Willie's tale is authentic and engaging."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>G. Clifton Wisler is the author of more than sixty-three books, many of them historical fiction for young adults. His ability to bring history alive in accessible and engaging ways make him a popular author for young readers.Mr. Wisler lives in Plano, Texas, where he continues to work on his doctoral dissertation on the history of the Ninth Texas Infantry Regiment in the Civil War.Gr. 5-7. When his Pa joins the Union army as a soldier, 11-year-old Willie goes along as a drummer boy. They're assigned to different companies of the Third Vermont Regiment, and Willie shares a tent with some older boys from back home. As the Army of the Potomac marches through Virginia, their war consists mainly of camp life, discomfort, and retreat, though they see action at Lee's Mill and Malvern Hill. Willie meets Lincoln twice and receives the Congressional Medal of Honor. Despite the publisher's disclaimer that "No character in this book is intended to represent any actual person," Wisler's acknowledgments and epilogue concern the archival records he researched and the historical people represented in his novel, including Willie Johnston and other members of the regiment. Wisler achieves a credible presentation of camp life, though like many books based on real people and incidents, its ties to the facts seem to hamper it as fiction. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>E-Squared: Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments that Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality [Miniature Edition] (RP Minis)</h2><p><p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; Product measures 3.5 x 3 x 0.5 inches</strong></p> <p>Adapted from Pam Grout&#x2019;s <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book, <em>E-Squared</em>, this Running Press Miniature Edition&#x2122; is a lab manual with simple experiments that prove reality is malleable and that you shape your life with your mind.<br>The nine experiments, each of which can be conducted with absolutely no money and very little time, demonstrate that spiritual principles are as dependable as gravity and as consistent as Newton&#x2019;s laws of motion.<br></p></p><p><b>Pam Grout</b> is the author of sixteen books, three plays, a TV series, and two iPhone apps.

The stories of ten African-American women are reconstructed from historic documents found in century-old archives. Some of these women slaves, some were free, and some were born into slavery and found freedom in the old west. They were laundresses, freedom advocates, journalists, educators, midwives, business proprietors, religious converts, philanthropists, mail and freight haulers, and civil and social activists. These hidden historical figures include Biddy Mason, a slave who fought for her family's freedom; Elizabeth Thorn Scott Flood, a teacher determined to educate black children and aid them in leading better lives; and the mysterious Mary Ellen Pleasant, a civil rights crusader and savvy businesswoman.

This is especially true of first-generation college students, who are often unfamiliar with the norms and expectations of academia. College professors usually want to help, but many feel overwhelmed by the prospect of making extra time in their already hectic schedules to meet with these struggling students.<br><br><i>33 Simple Strategies for Faculty </i>is a guidebook filled with practical solutions to this problem. It gives college faculty concrete exercises and tools they can use both inside and outside of the classroom to effectively bolster the academic success and wellbeing of their students. To devise these strategies, educational sociologist Lisa M. Nunn talked with a variety of first-year college students, learning what they find baffling and frustrating about their classes, as well as what they love about their professors&#x2019; teaching.<br> &nbsp;<br> Combining student perspectives with the latest research on bridging the academic achievement gap, she shows how professors can make a difference by spending as little as fifteen minutes a week helping their students acculturate to college life. Whether you are a new faculty member or a tenured professor, you are sure to find <i>33 Simple Strategies for Faculty</i> to be an invaluable resource. &nbsp;</p><p>LISA M.

Each of the 20 cards forecasts a list of outcomes for the user ranging from the merely unpleasant (loss of hair, breakage, thwarted ambitions) to the downright horrible (catarrh, spasms, shriveling). The 32-page booklet provides interpretation of the cards courtesy of one Madame Groeda Weyrd, who Gorey tells us 'is of mixed Finnish and Egyptian extraction, has devoted her life to divination, and is the author of, among a shelf of other works, Floating Tambourines, a collection of esoteric verse, and The Future Speaks Through Entrails.'

Her <i>Look Baby </i>series has been raved about in <i>Publishers Weekly </i>and <i>Parenting Magazine.</i>PreSchool-K-Slight in text, but often visually striking, this book introduces the subject through photographs of five children, each of a different race or ethnicity. An African-American girl looks at herself, her shadow, her dog, and her city, each illustrated with a full-color photograph of her interacting with the topic at hand. The pattern is repeated by each child: "with my nose I smell popcorn, a horse, flowers, and garbage. With my mouth I taste..." Finally, readers are told, "With our five senses, we enjoy our world." While some of the pictures seem staged, they depict experiences common to many children of this age, and are sure to provoke discussion. The book is in the same vein as Aliki's My Five Senses (Crowell, 1989) and Henry Pluckrose's "Think About" series (Watts), all of which essentially offer visual images, making no attempt to explain how or why the senses work.

Born in 1971, Nihei made his debut in the comics world as the winner of the 1995 <i>Afternoon Magazine</i> Four Seasons Award for short stories. He then briefly worked as an assistant to veteran comicker Tsutomu Takahashi before making his break-through hit <i>BLAME!</i> (published by Tokyopop). <br><br>The <i>BLAME!</i> franchise was so well received worldwide, that it inspired an animated mini-series and eventually drew the attention of Marvel Comics in the US. Nihei would later go on to draw Wolverine (X-Men) and HALO comics for Marvel to great fanfare. An architectural student, Nihei's early work were mainly wordless, relying on visuals and backgrounds to tell their stories.

The notorious Captain Kidd was rumored to have left part of his treasure somewhere along here, and as McGinnis and two friends started to dig, they found what turned out to be an elaborately engineered shaft constructed of oak logs, nonindigenous coconut mats, and landfill that came to be known as the Money Pit.<br>Ever since that summer day in 1795, the possibility of what might be hidden in the depths of a small island off the south coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, has made it the site of the world's longest, most expensive, and most perplexing treasure hunt. Author D'Arcy O'Connor recounts the fascinating stories and amazing discoveries of past and current treasure seekers who have sought Oak Island's fabled treasure for over two hundred years. It has baffled scientists and madmen, scholars and idiots, millionaires and get-rich-quick schemers, psychics, engineers, charlatans, and even a former president of the United States. The island has consumed the fortunes-and in some cases, the lives-of those who have obsessively set out to unlock its secret. Despite all their efforts, the mystery remains unsolved, and not a single dime of treasure has ever been recovered.<br>The present-day search is an archaeological dig exceeding anything ever done anywhere for similar purposes, and it may well result in the discovery of one of the world's richest and most historically significant treasures. But this is also the story of individuals who have dedicated years of their lives to discover what was buried long ago beneath this strange island. They are driven by a lust for gold, by archaeological curiosity, and by their determination to outwit the engineer who was responsible for the Oak Island enigma.<br></p><p>D&#39;Arcy O&#39;Connor, a former feature writer for The Wall Street Journal, is a round-the-world sailor, and a continuing freelancer and documentary film-maker.

And so it is only appropriate that the mouse is incorporated into nearly every aspect of the Disney parks and resorts. In some cases, Mickey's presence is obvious-as in the Partners statue that stands in the center of the hub at the end of Main Street, U.S.A. But in other cases, Mickey's influence is a bit more hidden. . . .<br><br>So what exactly is a Hidden Mickey? Quite simply, it's an artistic representation of Mickey that was intentionally placed amid the architecture and design of the parks and resorts. Oftentimes it's the familiar three-circle shape of his ears and head. Other times it might be a profile of his face or a full-body silhouette. Disneyland Guests with keen eyes can tell you that Mickey pops up all over the resort, often in the most unexpected places.<br><br>With this resort wide scavenger hunt, you'll be guided toward each Hidden Mickey, first with a general hint-if you're up for a challenge-and then with a very specific clue.

But writing&#x2019;s hard. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Write her a letter,&#x201d; Celina Aunty said, laying a sheet of pa�per on the desk. Paper remade from wilted, dirty, hopeless litter that had been rescued, scrubbed clean, and reshaped. Even the pencil she gave me was made from scraps. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You really like saving things, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; I said. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crinkly lines softened her stern face. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like giving up,&#x201d; she said. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rested her dark hand, warm and heavy, on my shoulder. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why should I write?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like you have her address.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I believe your words will reach her,&#x201d; Celina Aunty said. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re opposites,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You believe in everything and everybody. You&#x2019;re full of faith.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re full, too. You&#x2019;re full of feelings you won&#x2019;t share and thoughts you won&#x2019;t voice.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She&#x2019;s right about that. I don&#x2019;t talk to anyone here any more than I have to. The only person I want to talk to is you, Rukku. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe writing to you is the next best thing. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you could read my words, what would you want me to tell you? <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose you&#x2019;d like to hear the fairy tale you&#x2019;d make me tell every night we huddled together on the ruined bridge. The story that began with <i>Once upon a time, two sisters ruled a magi�cal land, </i>and ended with <i>Viji and Rukku, always together. </i><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That story was made up, of course. <br> Not that you&#x2019;d care whether it was true or not. For you, things were real that the rest of us couldn&#x2019;t see or hear. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I finished the story, you&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Viji and Rukku to�gether?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Always.&#x201d; I was confident. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our togetherness was one of the few things I had faith in. <br><br><b>2 <br> ROTTEN FRUIT </b><br><br> You always felt like a younger sister, Rukku. You looked younger, too, with your wide eyes and snub nose. You spoke haltingly, and you hunched your shoulders, which made you seem smaller than me, though you were born a year before. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Born when our father was a nice man, I suppose, because Amma said he was nice. Before. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Imagining Appa &#x201c;before&#x201d; took a lot of imagining. I was a good imaginer, but even so, I couldn&#x2019;t imagine him all the way nice. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The best I could do was think of him as a not-yet-all-the-way-rotten fruit. A plump yellow mango with just a few ugly bruises. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could imagine our mother picking him out, the way she&#x2019;d pick fruit from the grocer&#x2019;s stall, choosing the overripe fruit he was happy to give her for free. I could see Amma looking Appa over, hoping that if certain foul bits could be cut away, then sweetness, pure sweetness, would be left behind. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because Amma did choose him. Their marriage wasn&#x2019;t ar�ranged. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somehow he charmed her, charmed her away from her family, with whom she lost all touch. They were ashamed, she told me, ashamed and angry with her for eloping with someone from an even lower caste than the one she&#x2019;d been born into. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was all she ever said about her family. Not their names or where they lived or how many brothers and sisters she had. Only that they wanted nothing to do with us. And Appa&#x2019;s fam�ily&#x2014;if he had one&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t seem to know we existed either. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I wonder if they might have helped us if they&#x2019;d known. But maybe they&#x2019;d have done nothing, or acted like our neighbors and schoolmates, who did worse than nothing. Who sniggered or made rude comments when we walked past. Com�ments that upset you so much you stooped even lower than usual, so low it looked like you wanted to hide your head inside your chest. <br><br>On my eleventh birthday, when we came home from school, I was surprised to see saucepans full of food simmering on the stove. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Amma, you cooked!&#x201d; I loved evenings when Amma felt strong enough to prepare dinner for us, instead of the other way around. &#x201c;You even made payasam?&#x201d; I inhaled the sweet scent of milk rice that wafted through our apartment. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Not just that.&#x201d; Amma dug out a small money pouch from its hiding place, underneath the rice sack. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s two hundred rupees, for you to buy something for yourself.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Two hundred rupees!&#x201d; I was so astonished that I almost dropped the pouch before securing it to my ankle-length skirt. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been saving a little of what Appa gives me for food and rent. I wanted to buy something, but I was too tired to go shopping for a gift, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure what you&#x2019;d like.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;This is the best gift, Amma. Thanks.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sweet?&#x201d; you said. &#x201c;Sweets for Rukku?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Proper food first,&#x201d; Amma said. &#x201c;For you both.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amma heaped rice onto our plates and ladled some hot, spicy rasam over the top. She started eating, but you just stared at your food, your hands crossed over your chest. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Come on, Rukku.&#x201d; I rolled a mouthful of rice and rasam into a ball and tried to feed you. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No!&#x201d; you yelled. &#x201c;Sweet! Sweeeeet!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get angry, Rukku. Please? Eat and I&#x2019;ll tell you a story tonight.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Story?&#x201d; You calmed down. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amma looked at me gratefully. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We&#x2019;d just finished our dinner when we heard Appa&#x2019;s heavy footsteps. The sound of him staggering up the stairs to our apartment told us all we needed to know. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Get in your room. Quick,&#x201d; Amma said. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sweet,&#x201d; you moaned, but your hand met mine and we crept into our bedroom. In the darkness, we huddled together, unable to block out the sound of Appa yelling at Amma. We rocked back and forth, taking comfort in each other&#x2019;s warmth. <br><br>Appa broke Amma&#x2019;s arm that night, before storming out of the house. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I need to see a doctor,&#x201d; Amma came and told us. Her voice was tight with pain. &#x201c;Stay with Rukku. If they see her&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#x2019;t finish her sentence. She didn&#x2019;t need to. She&#x2019;d told me a million times how scared she was that if you set foot in a hospital, the doctors might lock you away in &#x201c;a mental institution.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You curled up on our mattress with your wooden doll, Marapachi. I smoothed your brow. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The patch of moonlight that slipped past the rusty iron bars on our window fell on the book that our teacher, Parvathi, had given me before she moved away. No other teacher had ever been so nice, even though I was often at the top of the class. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I opened the book. In a shaking voice, I read you a tale about a poor, low-caste girl who&#x2019;d refused to accept the life oth�ers thought she should lead. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You think we could change our lives, like that girl did?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And Parvathi Teacher. And Subbu. Or at least his family. They all left for a better life in a big city.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subbu had been the only friend we&#x2019;d had in school. His long face and thin frame had made him look as weak as a blade of grass, but he&#x2019;d always told off the other children who teased us. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I miss him, Rukku. Think he ever misses us?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You answered me with a snore. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was glad you&#x2019;d fallen asleep, but I stayed awake, worrying and hoping. I hoped Amma would finally tell someone about how she had been hurt, and that they&#x2019;d swoop down and rescue us. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I should have known she&#x2019;d never tell. <br> &nbsp;<br><b>3 <br> BREAKING </b><br><br>The next day, Amma pretended like nothing had happened. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You never pretended. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Owwa,&#x201d; you announced. You patted our mother&#x2019;s good arm and stroked the sling on the broken one. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Appa came home that evening, his eyes bloodshot and his breath reeking as usual, he set packages wrapped in newspaper on the cracked kitchen counter. &#x201c;Presents for my girls.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How nice!&#x201d; Amma&#x2019;s voice was full of false cheer. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sorry I lost my temper last night.&#x201d; He placed a finger on her chin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never do it again. Promise.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw hope creep into Amma&#x2019;s eyes. Desperate, useless hope. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, I wanted to shout at her, more than at him. <i>Have you forgotten how often he&#x2019;s broken his promises? </i><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He ripped open one of the packages and dangled a pair of bangles in front of you. But before your fingers could close over them, he jerked them away. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Catch!&#x201d; He launched one bangle over your head, and as you slowly raised your hands to try to catch it, he sent the other flying so fast it struck you before tinkling to the floor. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You squeaked like a trapped mouse. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He laughed. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How dare he think it was funny to trick you. How dare he mock your trust. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he tossed a package in my direction, I didn&#x2019;t even try to catch it. I crossed my arms and watched it land on the floor. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How bad both our girls are at catching!&#x201d; Amma&#x2019;s voice was high-pitched and tense as a taut string. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Stupid,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;One with slow hands, and the other with a slow brain.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not stupid!&#x201d; I picked up my package and flung it at him. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nostrils flaring, he slapped me. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; Amma begged. &#x201c;Not the children.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You leaped and thrust your doll between me and Appa. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He kicked out at you. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At you. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furious, I lunged at him. You joined in, and the two of us barreled into him together. He swayed and fell backward, but not before he struck your face. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amma caught him, instead of letting him crack his head on the floor. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Let them be,&#x201d; she pleaded. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Appa grunted. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was sure he&#x2019;d come at us again, but instead, he crawled into their bedroom and passed out for the night. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You ran a finger around the edges of what felt like a painful bruise blooming on my cheek. &#x201c;Owwa,&#x201d; you said, paying no attention to your own wound. &#x201c;Poor Viji.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With her unbroken arm, Amma grabbed a towel. She dipped it into the cool water in our earthen pot and pressed it against your bleeding lip. You struggled, until I promised it would help you heal. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Leave Appa,&#x201d; I told Amma. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go somewhere else.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How would we live, Viji?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find a way.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t manage without him. No one employs uneducated women with no skills.&#x201d; Her voice was flat. Defeated. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t talk back anymore, Viji. I couldn&#x2019;t stand it if he hurt you again.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He hurts you all the time,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And now that he&#x2019;s started on us, nothing&#x2019;s going to stop him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#x2019;t argue. Her head drooped, and when she finally found the strength to lift her eyes to mine, I could see she knew what I&#x2019;d said was true. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t bear seeing you hurt, but how can I stop him?&#x201d; She gazed at the pictures of the Gods and Goddesses smiling down serenely from our kitchen wall. As if they&#x2019;d suddenly leap into life and start helping. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Please understand, Viji.&#x201d; She was begging me, the same pathetic way she&#x2019;d begged Appa. &#x201c;I promised . . . to be a good wife . . . no matter what. I can&#x2019;t leave.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But after what he&#x2019;d done to you, I couldn&#x2019;t stay. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I gazed at Amma&#x2019;s trembling chin, I realized how differ�ent we were. Amma trusted that if she put up with things, she&#x2019;d be rewarded with another, better life after she died. It made no sense to me why any God who made us suffer in this life would start caring for us in the next. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I wanted a better future, I needed to change the life we had. Now. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The more I thought about our differences, the surer I felt that I could protect you better than she could. She hadn&#x2019;t tried to stop Appa from beating us. All she&#x2019;d done was beg. I would never become like her, I promised myself. I&#x2019;d never beg anyone for anything. <br><br>At the first light of dawn, while Amma and Appa slept, I woke and changed into my best blouse and ankle-length pavadai as si�lently as I could. Around my waist, I tied the drawstring purse with Amma&#x2019;s gift of money. Then I crammed a sheet, some tow�els, and a change of clothes for each of us into our school back�packs. I added a bar of soap, a comb, and the pink plastic jar of tooth powder to your bag; from the kitchen, I grabbed a bunch of bananas&#x2014;your favorite fruit&#x2014;to add to mine. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our bags were heavy, but I couldn&#x2019;t bear to leave behind the book from Parvathi Teacher. Carrying it along was like tak�ing her blessings with us, I told myself as I forced it into my bag. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I woke you. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Shhup. Don&#x2019;t say a word, Rukku, please. Just get changed. We&#x2019;re leaving.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sleep weighed down your eyelids, but you did as I asked. Perhaps it felt like a dream to you. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we shuffled toward the front door, you cast a bewildered glance at our parents&#x2019; bedroom. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Amma?&#x201d; you said. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Memories of our rare happy moments gleamed in my mind, like sunshine slipping into a dark room: the day Amma had helped you make a bead necklace, the night she&#x2019;d sat by our beds and listened to the story I&#x2019;d told you. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment I hesitated. But then I glanced at your cut lip&#x2014;the proof Appa had given me that he&#x2019;d keep on hurting you as long as you were nearby. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We had to leave, right away, before fear or doubt slowed me down.</p><h2>Red Sled (Classic Board Books)</h2><p><b>Find out what happens when a cast of unlikely woodland friends discover a well-loved sled outside a cozy cabin in this whimsical wintertime Classic Board Book!</b><br><br>In this almost wordless story, a host of woodland creatures take a child&#x2019;s sled for a nighttime joy ride.

It has the potential to revolutionize money and banking while wrestling the rest of the internet away from today's gatekeepers. <br><br>But it&#x2019;s notoriously hard to understand, as most of the existing explanations are either too technical or too ideological. <br><br>The Story of the Blockchain is a book written for the rest of us. Using a series of anecdotes from everyday life and analogies from more relatable areas, Omid Malekan takes you back to the very beginning, walking you through why this technology was invented in the first place, how it&#x2019;s being utilized today, and why it might eventually impact everything. <br><br>Each chapter covers a unique aspect of this frontier technology, like privacy, initial coin offerings or what it's like to be invested in the coins themselves, but the overall book still flows like an easy to follow story, one that ends with a simple tutorial on how to safely make your first cryptocoin transactions. When all is said and done, you won't just understand this revolution. You'll be a part of it.</p><p>Omid Malekan has been involved in the blockchain space as an investor, advocate and consultant since 2014, making every possible mistake so you won&#x2019;t have to.

Centered around the experiences of two young African-American boys, Huey and Riley, who move from inner-city Chicago to the suburbs (or the "boondocks" to them), the strip fuses hip-hop sensibilities with Japanese anime-style drawings and a candid discussion of race.

Based on a close canonical reading of Scripture, this book offers a new approach to the challenge of reconciling the Christian confession of a loving God with the realities of suffering and evil. John Peckham offers a constructive proposal for a theodicy of love that upholds both the sovereignty of God and human freedom, showing that Scripture points toward a framework for thinking about God's love in relation to the world.</p><p>Based on a close canonical reading of Scripture, <i>Theodicy of Love</i> offers a new approach to the challenge of reconciling the Christian confession of a loving God with the realities of suffering and evil in the world.<br><br>"John Peckham's <i>Theodicy of Love</i> fills an important gap in the literature addressing the problem of evil; his book is both faithful to Scripture and philosophically sound. Peckham effectively builds his case in a manner that neither affirms evil as necessary; diminishes genuine human freedom; nor surrenders divine omnipotence, omniscience, or omnibenevolence. His bold treatment of cosmic conflict in relation to the problem of evil is insightful. Well done!"<br>--<b>Paul Copan</b>, Palm Beach Atlantic University; coauthor of <i>Did God Really Command Genocide?<br></i><br>"Peckham's new book builds on his previous acclaimed work on the love of God. In this book he confronts head-on what is arguably the single most difficult challenge to the Christian conviction that God's character is one of perfect benevolence. While the book is aimed specifically at the philosophical problem of evil, Peckham comes armed for the task with an impressive command of biblical and theological scholarship, as well as the relevant philosophical literature. This is a book to be welcomed by all who are invested in this vitally important and deeply contested issue."<br>--<b>Jerry&nbsp;L. Walls</b>, Houston Baptist University<br><br>"A new Peckham book is always an event, and <i>Theodicy of Love</i> does not disappoint. Theologically and philosophically adept, exegetically sound, and analytically rigorous, it offers a rich biblical theodicy in the face of the evidential problem of evil. Peckham's contribution goes beyond the limitations of a freewill defense and avoids skeptical theism while acknowledging significant epistemic limitations--all while skillfully avoiding an array of potential pitfalls. As fascinating as it is fearless, Peckham's judicious and perspicacious account assigns primacy to the suffering love of God, who--while operating within certain temporary covenantal strictures--is demonstrating his faithfulness and goodness against cosmic allegations to the contrary. This is an important contribution to theodicy that illuminates a plethora of challenging questions."<br>--<b>David Baggett</b>, Rawlings School of Divinity, Liberty University<b>John C.

In <i>The Other Side of Sadness</i>, psychologist and emotions expert George Bonanno argues otherwise. Mourning is far from predictable, and all of us share a surprising ability to be resilient. Our inborn emotions--anger and denial, but also relief and joy--help us deal effectively with loss. To expect or require only grief-stricken behavior from the bereaved does them harm. In fact, grieving goes beyond mere sadness, and it can actually deepen interpersonal connections and even lead to a new sense of meaning in life. <br><i>The Other Side of Sadness</i> is a must-read for those going through the death of a loved one, mental health professionals, readers interested in neuroscience and positive psychology, and anyone eager to understand our ability to thrive in the face of adversity. <br></p><p><b>George A. Bonanno</b> is professor of clinical psychology and Chair of the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology at Columbia University's Teachers College. He lives in New York City with his wife and two children."Fascinating and readable ... a sensitive and sensible view of loss."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Times</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A deep and intelligent book.... It's heartening to discover that grieving is not 'work,' we don't have to be successful at it, and we're stronger than we know."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Double X, Slate</b></i></b><br><br>"This is a valuable book for Bonanno's application of the scientific method to a field that badly needs it."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New Scientist</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Perhaps the most renowned grief researcher in the United States ...

The best part? It's still funny. The rhythms, the plodding rhymes, the illustrations, the clever play on the overused trope of the world at bedtime -- they all work together to take <i>Seriously, Just Go to Sleep</i> beyond parody and into the realm where good children's books belong: things that parents, and children, can honestly come to from different places and enjoy together. I can imagine reading <i>Seriously, Go to Sleep</i> nightly, and even to the point where you're begging the child to choose something else (the ultimate compliment for a picture book) and yet still finding something to enjoy. It captures a different 'zeitgeist' of modern parenting."<br>--<b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>"From the team that touched off the irreverent humor trend <i>Go the F**k to Sleep</i>, author Adam Mansbach and illustrator Ricardo Cortes, comes a new kid-friendly version of their instant comic classic. <i>Seriously, Just Go to Sleep</i> brings children in on the joke, helping them understand their own tactics and why their parents just want them to go . . . to sleep."<br>--<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>Critical success for the original <i>Go the F*** to Sleep</i>, a #1 best seller at: <i>New York Times</i>, Amazon.com, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, and many more!<br><br><i>Seriously, Just Go to Sleep</i> is the G-rated, traditional-sized, children's version of the book every parent has been talking about. <i>Go the F*** to Sleep,</i> the picture book for adults, became a cultural sensation by striking a universal chord for parents. Now, Adam Mansbach and Ricardo Cort�s reunite with <i>Seriously, Just Go to Sleep,</i> inviting the children themselves in on the joke. As parents know, kids are well aware of how difficult they can be at bedtime. With Cort�s's updated illustrations (including a cameo appearance by Samuel L. Jackson, who narrated the audio book version of <i>Go the F*** to Sleep</i>) and Mansbach's new child-appropriate narrative, the book allows kids to recognize their tactics, giggle at their own mischievousness, and empathize with their parents' struggles--a perspective most children's books don't capture. Most importantly, it provides a common ground for children and their parents to talk about one of the most stressful aspects of parenting.<br><br><i>Seriously, Just Go to Sleep</i> came to be when Mansbach read a highly censored rendition of the original book to his three-year-old daughter, and she recognized herself as the culprit and was delighted. "We were getting a lot of feedback from parents, saying that their kids loved the book--read in an altered form--because they recognized themselves in the character of the mischievous kid who's winning the bedtime battle, and thought it was hilarious. So we figured we&#x2019;d do a companion volume that lets kids in on the fun."<br></p><p><p>Adam Mansbach's novels include <i>The End of the Jews,</i> winner of the California Book Award, and the best-selling <i>Angry Black White Boy,</i> a <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> Best Book of 2005.

The newly resurrected, but no less rebellious, Lestat addresses a mysterious twenty-first century vampire genocide with the same panache, self-absorption, and drama readers have come to know and love. Rice masterfully populates the present-day storyline with a cast of characters from her previous novels along with new blood, so to speak, and reading this book is like seeing old friends whom you&#x2019;d sort of forgotten about, but are thrilled to meet again&#x2014;even if you are reading about them for the first time. <i>Prince Lestat</i> raises interesting questions about the boundaries of science, conflicting beliefs, and a universal need to belong; a welcome return to a narrative that spawned an entire subgenre of fiction. --<i>Seira Wilson</i></p>Anne Rice is the author of thirty-two books.

Tabby is uncomfortable around this noisy new toy but hides her feelings when she sees how happy it makes him. Mr. Putter eventually decides to give his beloved possession to an eager child. Rylant tells her story with clear yet lyrical prose, but the tale itself is a slight one, burdened with too much sentiment and not enough humor.

In doing so, he set into motion a series of events that defined him and his associates as the largest homegrown marijuana syndicate in American history, also known as&nbsp;the Cornbread Mafia. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Author James Higdon&#x2014;whose relationship with Johnny Boone, currently a federal fugitive, made him the first journalist subpoenaed under the Obama administration&#x2014;takes readers back to the 1970s and &#x2019;80s and the clash between federal and local law enforcement and a band of Kentucky farmers with moonshine and pride in their bloodlines. By 1989 the task force assigned to take down men like Johnny Boone had arrested sixty-nine men and one woman from busts on twenty-nine farms in ten states, and seized two hundred tons of pot. Of the seventy individuals arrested, zero talked.&nbsp;How it all went down is a tale of Mafia-style storylines emanating from the Bluegrass State, and populated by Vietnam veterans and weed-loving characters caught up in Tarantino-level violence and heart-breaking altruism. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accompanied by a soundtrack of rock-and-roll and rhythm-and-blues, this work of dogged investigative journalism and history is told by Higdon in action-packed, colorful and riveting detail.</p></p><p>JAMES HIGDON has worked for the Louisville Courier Journal, the New York Times, and <br>PBS Frontline&#x2019;s Tehran Bureau; contributed material to The Prairie Home Companion;<br>and researched the NYPD for the police drama series NYC-22.

The area was renowned for distilling whiskey, legal and otherwise, and after exposure to the war in Vietnam, many locals&nbsp;turned to the cultivation of marijuana and thrived. The characters Higdon reveals to us are not notably different from Protestant thugs of the hills, but not one has ever snitched.

"But cats / can't fly / and they / can't soar; / and birds / know what / their wings are for." Lifesize and sporting plumage that, whether brilliant or muted, manages to suggest a feather's almost infinitely variegated hues, these are birds that truly soar.

(<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>PreSchool-Grade 2-- This unusual book is both a story and a beginning nature guide. A pet cat wants to vary his diet with wild birds, but each attempt gains him only feathers. Twelve different bird species are carefully illustrated with scientific accuracy and can be used to teach identification; the final four pages offer additional facts. On each page, the bird's typical call is printed and plants pictured are named. The rhyming story appears in large, bold typeface, but the rhythm is somewhat awkward and the word choices forced. Against the white background, cut-outs of painted paper create vivid shapes that are not realistic and yet manage to include all the field identification marks. Small children will appreciate the apparent simplicity of the pictures while older readers will be more aware of their subtleties. --Carolyn Caywood, Virginia Beach Public Library<br> (<i>School Library Journal</i> )</p><h2>The Little Sailboat</h2><p>Mr. Small is a sailor in this maritime adventure!

The artist's visual and stylistic choices in breaking up the panels to illustrate Theseus and the Minotaur inside the labyrinth are especially delightful. Poseidon's tale is the story of a dysfunctional family with a large number of monstrous children, and this book will send readers scrambling for the closest copy of Edith Hamilton's Mythology to read more about the other characters mentioned. Luckily, O'Connor includes an Olympian family tree and lists of recommended books and websites to help readers delve further into their stories. This is a compelling page-turner for readers unfamiliar with the myths as well as for kids who love mythology but would like to see it brought to life in a new way.-Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

David Maraniss now brings the great baseball player brilliantly back to life in <i>Clemente: The Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero,</i> a book destined to become a modern classic. Much like his acclaimed biography of Vince Lombardi, <i>When Pride Still Mattered,</i> Maraniss uses his narrative sweep and meticulous detail to capture the myth and a real man.<br><br>Anyone who saw Clemente, as he played with a beautiful fury, will never forget him. He was a work of art in a game too often defined by statistics. During his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, he won four batting titles and led his team to championships in 1960 and 1971, getting a hit in all fourteen World Series games in which he played. His career ended with three-thousand hits, the magical three-thousandth coming in his final at-bat, and he and the immortal Lou Gehrig are the only players to have the five-year waiting period waived so they could be enshrined in the Hall of Fame immediately after their deaths.<br> <br> There is delightful baseball here, including thrilling accounts of the two World Series victories of Clemente's underdog Pittsburgh Pirates, but this is far more than just another baseball book. Roberto Clemente was that rare athlete who rose above sports to become a symbol of larger themes. Born near the canebrakes of rural Carolina, Puerto Rico, on August 18, 1934, at a time when there were no blacks or Puerto Ricans playing organized ball in the United States, Clemente went on to become the greatest Latino player in the major leagues. He was, in a sense, the Jackie Robinson of the Spanish-speaking world, a ballplayer of determination, grace, and dignity who paved the way and set the highest standard for waves of Latino players who followed in later generations and who now dominate the game.<br> <br> The Clemente that Maraniss evokes was an idiosyncratic character who, unlike so many modern athletes, insisted that his responsibilities extended beyond the playing field. In his final years, his motto was that if you have a chance to help others and fail to do so, you are wasting your time on this earth. Here, in the final chapters, after capturing Clemente's life and times, Maraniss retraces his final days, from the earthquake to the accident, using newly uncovered documents to reveal the corruption and negligence that led the unwitting hero on a mission of mercy toward his untimely death as an uninspected, overloaded plane plunged into the sea.</p><p>David Maraniss is an associate editor at <i>The Washington Post</i> and a distinguished visiting professor at Vanderbilt University. He has won two Pulitzer Prizes for journalism and was a finalist three other times. Among his bestselling books are biographies of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Roberto Clemente, and Vince Lombardi, and a trilogy about the 1960s&#x2014;<i>Rome 1960</i>; <i>Once in a Great City </i>(winner of the RFK Book Prize); and <i>They Marched into Sunlight</i> (winner of the J. Anthony Lucas Prize and Pulitzer Finalist in History). <i>A Good American Family </i>is his twelfth book.<b>Memory and Myth</b><p>The familiar sounds of modern baseball, pings of aluminum bats punctuating the steady drone of a crowd, can be heard from the street a half-block away. It is late on a Sunday afternoon in February, overcast and drizzly in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Inside the stadium, there is a game going on, the Escuela de Deportiva against Bayam�n. Nothing special, just teenage boys playing ball, the way they do every afternoon, and then the right fielder from Deportiva scoops up a base hit and fires to second, his throw a bullet -- low, hard, right on the bag. Groups of men huddle in the stands, talking, laughing, playing cards, barely paying attention, or so it seems until the throw. It elicits a murmur of recognition, and suddenly they come alive, stirred by communal memory. All fires are one fire, the novelist Julio Cort�zar once wrote. And all arms are one arm. The throw from right field reminds them of the original, the unsurpassable arm of the man for whom the stadium is named, Roberto Clemente.</p><p>Beyond the stadium, closer to the street, stands a cenotaph thirty feet long and seven and a half feet high. It is the nearest thing to a headstone for Carolina's favorite son. On its three panels the sculptor Jos� Buscaglia has etched the stations of the cross of Roberto Clemente's thirty-eight years on this earth. In the far left panel, Roberto is a babe, held in the arms of his mother in the barrio of San Ant�n, and his father is seen working in the nearby cane fields. In the far right panel, Clemente passes from greatness into legend; first he is being honored for his three-thousandth hit, then his spirit is received by a figure of death in the Atlantic's watery grave, and finally his widow holds the plaque for his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. But the center panel is the most telling. There, between scenes of Clemente batting, running, fielding, throwing, visiting hospitals, and consoling the sick and the poor, he is depicted standing regal and alone, holding a lamb.</p><p>Memory and myth are entwined in the Clemente story. He has been dead for more than three decades, yet he remains vivid in the sporting consciousness while other athletes come and go, and this despite the fact that he played his entire career in relative obscurity, away from the mythmakers of New York and Los Angeles. Forty public schools, two hospitals, and more than two hundred parks and ballfields bear his name, from Carolina, Puerto Rico, where he was born, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he played, to far-off Mannheim, Germany. In the world of memorabilia, the demand for anything Clemente is second only to Mickey Mantle, and far greater than Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Juan Marichal, or any other black or Latin players. Extraordinary as he was, Clemente was not the greatest who ever played the game, yet there was something about him that elevated him into his own realm. Much of it had to do with the way he died. He was young. He went down in a plane crash. His body was lost to the sea, never found. He was on a mission of mercy, leaving his family on New Year's Eve to come to the aid of strangers. In Spanish, Clemente means merciful. Some of it had to do with the way he looked and played on the ball field, No. 21, perfectly cut in his Pirates uniform, a portrait of solemn beauty, with his defiant jaw and soulful eyes. And much of it had to do with the way he lived. In sainthood, his people put a lamb in his arms, but he was no saint, and certainly not docile. He was agitated, beautiful, sentimental, unsettled, sweet, serious, selfless, haunted, sensitive, contradictory, and intensely proud of everything about his native land, including himself. To borrow the words of the Puerto Rican poet Enrique Zorrilla, what burned in the cheeks of Roberto Clemente was "the fire of dignity."</p><p></p><p>Copyright � 2006 by David Maraniss</p><p></p>6<p>Alone at the Miracle</p><p>The last time the Pirates played in a World Series, in 1927, the opponents were the same New York Yankees. Then the American League champions terrorized opposing pitchers with a lineup of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, Bob Meusel and Tony Lazzeri, now it was Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, Yogi Berra and Moose Skowron. Murderers' Row old and new, one baseball legend long established, another in the making. The formula was identical in either case: audacious power, solid pitching, pinstripes, intimidation, all rendered glorious by the self-centered hyperbole of New York and its sporting press.</p><p>Part of the lore of the 1927 Yankees was a boast that the Pirates, after watching the famed sluggers take batting practice before the series opener, felt so overmatched they folded and lost four straight. Harold (Pie) Traynor, Pittsburgh's Hall of Fame third baseman, had bristled at that story for decades, insisting that it was apocryphal. By Traynor's account, the Pirates were in the clubhouse poring over a scouting report when the Yankees took their pregame cuts. Whatever prodigious shots Ruth and Gehrig stroked during batting practice, the Pirates saw none of them. But the debunking of this myth did not sit well with baseball's commissioner, Ford Frick, for the particular reason that it was Frick himself, as a young sportswriter for the <i>New York Journal,</i> who had spread the story in the first place.</p><p>The 1960 Pirates were rated 13-10 underdogs by the bookies, but seemed even less likely than their predecessors to be awed by New York, even though these Yankees had won their last fifteen games of the season heading into the World Series. "We'll fight 'em until our teeth fall out and then we'll grab 'em with our gums," snarled Don Hoak, sounding like the former boxer and inveterate scrapper that he was. It was the nature of this team, Hoak said, that they would always rise to the challenge of the better opponents. Virgil Trucks, the batting practice pitcher, told anyone who approached him in the days before the series opener that Pittsburgh was the most relaxed team he had ever seen. Relaxed and gabby. When it came to quotable quotes, Pittsburgh was a gold mine for visiting sportswriters. Hoak, shortstop Groat (recovered from his wrist injury and ready to play), outfielder Gino Cimoli, trainer Danny Whelan, ace Deacon Law, pudgy old Smoky Burgess (who talked so much behind the plate Richie Ashburn once beseeched the ump to shut him up before Ashburn bopped him over the head with his bat), Vinegar Bend Mizell, the big galoots at first, Dick Stuart and Rocky Nelson, and the story-spinning dark Irishman, manager Danny Murtaugh (prone to blabbing about anything but the game itself) -- they all were go-to guys on deadline. The <i>Post-Gazette,</i> further short-cutting the process, enlisted Hoak, Groat, and Law to write stories during the series, or at least columns published under their by-lines.</p><p>Everyone was in on the action, it seemed, except the Pirate in the middle of the lineup who roamed right field. Roberto Clemente was indisputably an important member of the team, yet also in many ways alone. At the end of his sixth and finest season, he was still separated by culture, race, language, and group dynamics. He was the lone black player in the starting lineup and a Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican, while none of the sportswriters for the major dailies in New York or Pittsburgh were black or spoke Spanish. Life is defined by images, especially public life, and the Pirates image was that of a band of scrappy, happy-go-lucky, fearless, gin-playing, hard-drinking, crew-cut, tobacco-chewing white guys. Where was the place in that picture for the proud, regal, seemingly diffident Roberto Clemente? He had led the team in runs batted in and total bases, finished second in batting average, hits, game-winning hits, runs scored, home runs, and triples, had the best arm on the team, played with style and every bit as much grit as Hoak or Groat, yet now was the invisible man. In the run-up to the World Series, the writers of Pittsburgh and New York, for all their overwrought coverage of the spectacle, gave Clemente barely a passing glance.</p><p>A notable exception, as usual, was the <i>Pittsburgh Courier,</i> the black weekly that had been paying close attention to Clemente all season. On the weekend before the series opener, sports editor Bill Nunn Jr. saw Clemente on the street in Schenley Heights, the middle-class black neighborhood where they both lived, and asked him how he felt about facing the mighty Yankees. The Pirates would win, Clemente assured him, his words echoing Hoak and Trucks. Although the Yankees had more power, he believed Pittsburgh was the better team, stocked with hard-nosed players who could not be intimidated. "We've been a relaxed team all season and I expect us to be the same in the Series," he said. "Pressure didn't get us down during the National League race. We fought off Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Los Angeles without cracking. Now that we've come this far, we aren't going to look back now." In Clemente's estimation, the Braves, not the Yankees, were the second-best team in baseball. "If the Braves had won the pennant, they would have been good enough to beat the Yankees, too." As for playing in Yankee Stadium, Clemente said he would not be haunted by the outfield ghosts of Ruth and DiMaggio, but he was concerned about the late-afternoon shadows. He had played there in the second 1960 All-Star game and found the ball hard to follow.</p><p>Aside from Nunn's interview, the other notice Clemente received before the series was negative. Someone had leaked a scouting report from the Yankees suggesting that the most effective way to pitch him was inside. "Knock him down the first time up and forget him," was the dismissive summary. Clemente laughed when asked about it, but the report bothered him. Like many black stars of that era, in a tradition that went back to Jackie Robinson, he got brushed back nearly every series, and he suspected that opposing pitchers chose him for retaliation in part because of the color of his skin.

The Paintings</h2><p><p>At the age of six, Salvador Dal� (1904&#x2013;1989) wanted to be a cook. At the age of seven, he wanted to be Napoleon. &#x201c;Since then,&#x201d; he later said, &#x201c;my ambition has steadily grown, and my megalomania with it. Now I want only to be Salvador Dal�, I have no greater wish.&#x201d; Throughout his life, Dal� was out to become Dal�: that is, one of the most significant artists and eccentrics of the 20th century.</p><p>This weighty volume is the most complete study of Dal�&#x2019;s painted works ever published. After years of research, Robert Descharnes and Gilles N�ret located painted works by the master that had been inaccessible for years&#x2015;so many, in fact, that almost half the featured illustrations appear in public for the first time in this book.</p><p>More than a catalogue raisonn�, this book contextualizes Dal�&#x2019;s oeuvre and its meanings by examining contemporary documents, from writings and drawings to material from other facets of his work, including ballet, cinema, fashion, advertising, and objets d&#x2019;art. Without these crutches to support analysis, the paintings would simply be a series of many images.</p><p>The study is divided into two parts: the first examines Dal�&#x2019;s beginnings as an unknown artist. We witness how the young Dal� deployed all the isms&#x2015;Impressionism, Pointillism, Cubism, Fauvism, Purism and Futurism&#x2015;with playful mastery, and how he would borrow from prevailing trends before ridiculing and abandoning them. The second part unveils the conclusions of Dal�&#x2019;s lifelong inquiries, as well as the great legacy he left in works such as Tuna Fishing (1966/67) or Hallucinogenic Toreador (1970). It includes previously unpublished homages to Vel�zquez or Michelangelo, painted to the same end as the variations on past masters done by his contemporary, Picasso.</p><p>We discover how, motivated by the desire to tease out the secrets of great works and become a Vel�zquez of the mid-20th century, Dal� became Dal�.</p></p><p>Robert Descharnes (1926&#x2013;2014), a photographer and writer, published studies of major artists, among them Antoni Gaud�, Auguste Rodin, and Salvador Dal�.

Thirty-one American divisions - fully one-third of the U.S. Army raised during World War II - saw action in this battle. This battle was truly a test: could this conscript army from a pacifistic democracy defeat the best remaining men and machines that Germany's totalitarian government could produce? In <i>Battle of the Bulge</i>, author and artist <b>Wayne Vansant</b> brings readers into the frozen foxholes, haunting forests, and devastated villages of the Ardennes during that freezing cold winter. With meticulous historical accuracy and hand-drawn visuals that can tell a story in ways words alone cannot, Vansant recounts the Bulge with insightful detail, replaying the thrusts and volleys of both the combined Allied and German forces during the tumultuous battle. This is a story of panic, fear, and physical misery; a story of how a generation of draftees, National Guardsmen, and a small core of regular officers and NCOs faced those three elements as snow piled around their foxholes and the incessant drumming of artillery splintered the woods that gave them shelter. It is the story of men, frozen and hurting, far from home and holding little hope of seeing it again until the killing finally ended. Above all, <i>The</i><i>Battle of the Bulge</i> is a story of incredible triumph, now beautifully illustrated in graphic novel format for the first time.</p></p><p><p>Writer and artist <b>Wayne Vansant</b> was the primary artist for Marvel's <i>The 'Nam </i>for more than five years. Since then, he has written and illustrated many historically accurate graphic histories, such as <i>The Hammer and the Anvil</i>; <i>The Vietnam War: A Graphic History</i>; <i>Normandy: A Graphic History of D-Day, The Allied Invasion of Hitler's Fortress Europe</i> (Zenith Press, 2012); <i>Gettysburg: The Graphic History of America's Most Famous Battle and the Turning Point of the Civil War</i> (Zenith Press, 2013); <i>Grant vs. Lee: The Graphic History of the Civil War's Greatest Rivals During the Last Year of the War</i> (Zenith Press, 2013); <i>Bombing Nazi Germany: The Graphic History of the Allied Air Campaign That Defeated Hitler in World War II</i> (Zenith Press, 2013); and <i>The Red Baron: The Graphic History of Richthofen's Flying Circus and the Air War in WWI </i>(Zenith Press, 2014). He is currently working on <i>The Battle of the Bulge: A Graphic History of Allied Victory in the Ardennes, 1944-1945</i> (Zenith Press, 2014) for the 70th anniversary of the battle in December 2014.</p><p>"<i>The Battle of the Bulge</i> may be his best yet. He ramps up the tension found in his previous books another notch or two in this one, and I found myself turning pages even when my eyes were saying, "Turn off that lamp and go to sleep."... a well-researched narrative that is extremely engaging while still communicating the horrors and the sacrifices that were the Battle of the Bulge. Highly recommended." - <i><b>Armchair General</b></i></p><br><br><p>"In this sixth military-themed graphic novel for Zenith, Vansant (<i>The Red Baron</i>) literally sketches out an introductory work on one of the most important battles of World War II. He proceeds in a mostly chronological manner, beginning with Hitler's concept for the offensive named "Watch on the Rhine" in September 1944 through the official end of the fight on January 16, 1945. His narrative is broad, ranging from policy decisions at the strategic level and movements of particular units down to actions of small groups or individuals. He mentions atrocities on both sides. The book provides a series of maps that help give a sense of where distinct actions occurred in relation to one another. <b>Verdict</b> This book could serve as a useful introduction to the battle for adult or teen readers." <i><b>- Library Journal</b></i></p><br><br><p>"<i>Bombing Nazi Germany</i> (2013), and <i>The Red Baron</i> (2014, all Zenith) graphic novels, now addresses the major battle that led to Germany's surrender. The photo-realistic and full-color illustrations--Dwight D. Eisenhower, Adolf Hitler, and other major players are authentically captured--add gravity. This work is factual and mostly neutral, not going into the reasons behind the war, only the military strategies employed by each side. Though the book lacks a time line, the maps and detailed descriptions of the tanks used are a nice feature.

I spent decades studying steam and the work of Dead Men, in both old buildings and on library shelves. I traveled the country, haunting used-book stores, looking for engineering books that held the answers to questions that nagged at me. I was obsessed with this topic, and when I finally sat to write, I poured all that I had learned into this book, and as I wrote, I tried my best to make the words sound good to you - like we were together and having a conversation. I wanted you to know what I know and I wanted you to be able to do what I can do when it comes to old steam systems. This book arrived in 1992 and has since gone though dozens of printings. We&#39;ve sold it in every state as well as in foreign countries. Steam heat is everywhere there are old buildings, so why shouldn&#39;t you be the one with the answers? Dan Holohan</p><p>( ) Posted by Anonymous on March 22, 2011 @ 11:38 AM<br><br>"Eleven years ago, I bought an old brick house built in 1900. It had a steam system installed and I had no idea how to operate it....So in the first few months of ownership I managed to let the boiler run dry and the safety system didn\'t shut it down..... The boiler was ruined...cracked apart. I had very little money to hire in professionals. And, the few that did come out and try to patch the system, had no luck with it. A new boiler was mucho expensive, so I decided to look around for a used unit....even though I knew nothing about steam heating....I tried looking through any and every tech manual on HVAC for whatever information I could find....but, it was all very dry and technical, and assumed a lot of knowledge on my part. What a great day it was when my girlfriend came back from the public library with a copy of The Lost Art of Steam Heating! After reading that book from cover to cover a few times, I decided to tackle the job of installing a used Weil McClain boiler, all by myself. I was able to figure out that I had a two-pipe steam system, and the proper method for hooking up the replacement boiler. The system has been working like gang busters for eleven years... But, every time I\'ve shown anyone my boiler installation, I\'ve mentioned that there was this great, easy to understand book.....can\'t remember the title..... So, just today, I did a few searches and found The Lost Art of Steam Heating....and knew that must be the book! Even though, I might never need to work on my boiler like that again, I am so happy to get another copy of your book for two reasons....one, because it is also an entertaining read, and two, because, I\'m more than happy to pay for the knowledge that I was able to get from the library for free eleven years ago. Thanks again for making it possible for an average Do-It-Yourselfer like me to successfully complete a job that even many professional HVAC techs wouldn\'t want to tackle!" - Eric Butler --HeatingHelp.com Website<br><br>( ) Posted by Anonymous on March 22, 2011 @ 11:38 AM<br><br>"It must be considered the Flagship of Dan s fleet.

It is not the mentality of the slave of Christ. Professionalism has nothing to do with the essence and heart of the Christian ministry. The more professional we long to be, the more spiritual death we will leave in our wake. For there is no professional childlikeness, there is no professional tenderheartedness, there is no professional panting after God.<br><br>&#x201c;Brothers, we are not professionals. We are outcasts. We are aliens and exiles in the world. Our citizenship is in Heaven, and we wait with eager expectation for the Lord (Phil. 3:20). You cannot professionalize the love for His appearing without killing it. And it is being killed.<br><br>&#x201c;The world sets the agenda of the professional man; God sets the agenda of the spiritual man. The strong wine of Jesus Christ explodes the wine- skins of professionalism.&#x201d;</p><p><b>May the Holy Spirit use this book to help ignite the next generation with a passion to deny themselves and take up their crosses to serve Christ and his sheep from every tribe, tongue, and nation."</b>&nbsp;<b>Burk Parsons</b>Co-pastor of Saint Andrew's ChapelEditor of <i>Tabletalk</i> magazine&nbsp;<b>Piper has provided a generation of pastors with a clear and profound statement on our calling</b>, "<br><br><b>Matt Carter</b><br>Pastor, The Austin Stone Community Church, Austin, Texas<br><br><b>I hope every pastor reads this book and listens to its sane, practical, biblical advice.&#x201d;</b>&nbsp;<b>Kevin DeYoung</b>Senior Pastor at University Reformed Church in East Lansing, MichiganAuthor of <i>The Hole in Our Holiness</i>&nbsp;<b>It will challenge you.

Sure, there's buried treasure to be found, but nobody's digging up <i>anything</i> until Bonney Anne quits her caterwauling.

She lives in Greenville, South Carolina.<br><br>DAVID SHANNON is the illustrator of many popular picture books, including <i>How I Became a Pirate. </i>His numerous awards include a Caldecott Honor for <i>No, David!</i> He lives in Burbank, California.Plucky young Jeremy Jacob is reunited with Captain Braid Beard and his crew of daft, dentally challenged buccaneers in a follow-up to the bestselling <i>How I Became a Pirate</i>. This time, Jeremy clearly has the upper hand: he won't let the pirates dig up the treasure they buried in his backyard at the end of the previous book until they help him placate his cranky baby sister, Bonney Anne (pirate aficionados will note that her name is a nod to real-life female pirate Anne Bonny). The story unfolds rather predictably&#x2014;but just as entertainingly as the original: the pirates turn out to be washouts as nannies, jokes fly about dirty diapers and strained spinach, and, of course, "the wee lass" Bonney Anne ends up being the key to recovering the treasure. But Long's piratical dialogue still delivers a juicy read-aloud: what reader of any age won't relish the opportunity to say "Aargh!" or declare "Rock on!" as the crew does in unison when Braid Beard orders them to rock Bonney Anne to sleep? And Shannon's voluptuously colorful and comic paintings runneth over with comic mayhem, sly details (somehow, the pirates manage to find a pirate show on Jeremy's TV) and no end of goofy expressions.

Boxes are relatively quick to build, require only a small amount of material, and can be made in the smallest of woodshops. And, of course, they make wonderful gifts!<br> &nbsp;<br> In this all-new collection of boxes from one of America's premier box makers, Doug Stowe shows how to design and build eight distinctive boxes, in a variety of styles, sizes and techniques. Each chapter illustrates a key design principle--such as harmony, rhythm, texture, or contrast--and includes one or two design variations intended to help box makers grasp their own creative potentials.<br> &nbsp;<br> The focus of the book will be on giving the reader creative license to make boxes that are more personal in design. But all design issues aside, this will be a book of beautiful boxes that woodworkers of all levels will be eager to build.<br> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br>Introduction<br>Chapter 1: Lift Lid Rectangular Box<br>Chapter 2: Veneered Box<br>Chapter 3: Finger-Jointed Chest<br>Chapter 4: Bracelet Box<br>Chapter 5: Jewelry Box<br>Chapter 6: Sliding Top Jewelry Presentation Box<br>Chapter 7: Swivel Lid Box<br>Chapter 8: Magnetic Tower<br>Resources<br>Index</p><p>This book was inspired by my adult students and their curiosity concerning the design of beautiful boxes. As I teach and as I do my own creative box making, I find the principles and elements of design to be useful, helping me to think through the various design opportunities each box presents. It is my hope that this book helps my readers become more comfortable with their native design skills as they also develop greater technical proficiency in their work. The projects in this book should do the trick... helping woodworkers to become better designers as well as better craftsmen. It is not intended to be a comprehensive treatise on design. There are not enough projects for that. But I believe this book will encourage readers to become more courageous and effective in their box designs.<b>Doug Stowe is a professional furniture designer and box maker.

Long before he ever picked up a ball, Kiyohiko was just a skinny little kid in middle school barely beginning to discover his potential to become a track star... until a vicious bout with cancer cut off his track career far too soon.<br><br>A motorcycle accident, bone cancer, a speeding truck crashing into a boy on a stolen bicycle--tragic, life-changing events turn the worlds of three young men upside down. Three very different personalities have only one thing in common--their passion for basketball. Critically acclaimed, award-winning manga artist Takehiko Inoue doesn't pull any punches in this stunning portrayal of people struggling with serious life issues. Masterfully combining rich character development with beautifully detailed line art, Inoue, the creator of mega-hit masterpieces Slam Dunk and Vagabond, brings the medium of manga to a completely new level of storytelling.</p><p>Takehiko Inoue was born in Kagoshima prefecture in 1967. His first major success--the hugely popular 31-volume long basketball manga SLAM DUNK--sold over 100 million copies worldwide and catapulted him into the top ranks of Japanese manga artists. Besides manga, Inoue also worked on character design for the Playstation basketball game ONE ON ONE.Fourteen-year-old Kiyoharu&#x2019;s dreams of being a famous athlete&#x2014;he was one of the top sprinters in Japan&#x2014;are dashed when he is diagnosed with bone cancer and loses his ability to walk. Rather than give up on sports, he trains to be a basketball player, determined to not let his wheelchair get in the way. Later on, his team captain is hit by a truck, and he, too, loses the ability to walk. Lying alone in a hospital bed, he too must learn to accept his impairment, even though&nbsp;it doesn&#x2019;t come easy. This second volume in the manga series is a brutal, honest, piercing sports story about never giving up.&nbsp;The art is much more realistic than that found in most manga, and its story line practically sears off the pages.&nbsp;A prime example of how deep manga can be, with a tale as serious and complex as any novel or movie, this is a story that stays in the mind long after it&#x2019;s been read for its powerful art, story, and theme.

David Paulides, a former police investigator, has applied his skills to questioning Bigfoot witnesses. The results he has achieved in gaining access to witnesses and getting detailed information from them is both remarkable and intriguing. Furthermore, he commissioned a forensic police artist to meet with witnesses and sketch the creatures they saw. These drawings provide insights into the creature&#39;s nature never before realized. The result of this team&#39;s work is by far one of the most convincing accounts ever written on Bigfoot. The conclusion reached - that this creature, long revered by the Hoopa people, definitely inhabits the forested regions of Humboldt County in Northern California - is so convincing that those people who doubt Bigfoot&#39;s existence will be forced to think again!</p><p>Dave Paulides holds two degrees from the University of San Francisco, and has a professional background that includes twenty years in law enforcement and senior executive positions in the technology sector. A boyhood camping experience with his father in the late 1960s sparked his interest in Bigfoot. In 2004 he formed North America Bigfoot Search where his investigative and analytical experience were invaluable in researching Bigfoot sightings. He spent two years living among the Hoopa tribal members, listening to and recording their Bigfoot stories. The Hoopa Project is his first book, based upon his experiences in the Bluff Creek area of Northern California. Harvey Pratt was educated at the University of Central Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. During his forty-year career in law enforcement he was involved in many high-profile investigations, including the Green River killer, BTK killer, Ted Bundy, the I-5 killer, and the Murrah Federal Building bombing. Harvey is a highly skilled forensic sketch artist specializing in witness descriptive drawing, skull tracing, age progression, soft tissue reconstruction, and photo restoration. Harvey is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes and is recognized as one of the traditional Cheyenne Peace Chiefs.For Bigfoot believers and skeptics alike, a new book about sightings in the Hoopa area raises a number of challenging questions. The Hoopa Project by David Paulides is the first major research report of North American Bigfoot Search, an organization formed in 2004 by a group of Silicon Valley executives curious about prior experiences they'd had in Northern California forests. One significant difference between NABS and every other Bigfoot organization is our dedication to stay on a regional project until every possible angle of every sighting has been researched, witnesses interviewed, locations and food sources understood, and an extensive list of variables answered, the NABS Web site says. Paulides is the public face of NABS, which he says has members of the academic community who don't want to be exposed to ridicule by publically supporting research into the controversial topic. NABS' initial project was to gather every recorded report of a Bigfoot sighting in the four-county region of Del Norte, Humboldt, Trinity and Siskiyou counties (as well as southern portions of Jackson and Curry counties in Oregon). Paulides brought in Harvey Pratt, an FBI-trained forensic sketch artist with years of law enforcement experience in Oklahoma. A member of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes, Pratt's Native American background was helpful in gaining rapport with the primarily Hoopa tribal population in the valley. The bulk of The Hoopa Project is detailed reports of 16 incidents and 33 sightings in the Hoopa area, as well as forensic sketches of most of the sightings. The stories and pictures offer at least two important developments in Bigfoot research. One, they demonstrate that probably the vast majority of potential sightings go unreported. Many reports in the book came from witnesses who do not make a habit of sharing their experiences. Often, these people were professionals in fields such as teaching and forest management and some were tribal leaders, including one former Hoopa tribal councilwoman. They did not approach Paulides - they were approached by others who had already come to trust him. Paulides says he understands the hesitation to come forward. Coming from a police perspective, 50 percent of all rapes are not reported. Let's think about why that is, Paulides says. They're humiliated, embarrassed, intimidated by the legal process and don't want to come forward. A lot of the same issues apply to bigfoot. They don't want to be ridiculed or downtrodden by the community, so a lot of people shy away from anything that would draw ridicule. But the more you talk to people in the community, the more you see how prominent it is. Paulides says he's discussed this issue with others members of NABS, and they estimate that as many as 80 percent of all sightings go unreported. But for Paulides, the most interesting piece of information produced by the project was the overwhelming consensus about Bigfoot's appearance, which runs counter to popular modern depictions of the creature. --Matthew C. Durkee, The Daily Triplicate, California<br><br>I finished reading the David Paulides book, The Hoopa Project: Bigfoot Encounters In California, Hancock House Publishers, 2008, gifted to me by Investigator X, and I fully concur with her high assessment of the book. It is a valuable addition to a number of volumes aimed at answering the question: Do bigfoot exist? Even if the other volumes did not exist, this work is convincing enough for any open-minded investigator in answering the question positively. It is noteworthy that unlike other BF pro-existence studies, this one is based solely on generally misjudged and undervalued anecdotal evidence. Footprints, hairs, scat, DNA, vocalizations, their discussion and analyses are not to be found in this book. The author only gives a short list of such evidence collected in North America. Instead, there are many BF sketches done by a forensic artist on the basis of sighting reports by witnesses. And it is just eyewitnesses who are the main characters of the book which is its important and distinctive feature. As a former police investigator, the author is well equipped to understand the paramount role of the witness in our field of study and uses it in a professional way --Dmitri Bayanov, International Center of Hominology<br><br>The Hoopa Project, a new book by Dave Paulides is receiving rave reviews the likes of which I have not seen before in BF books. Since the last newsletter, these comments: Book of the year! A must read! Excellent read, we enjoyed it. ...best realistic BF sketches. Paulides did his homework. Damn good. ...who is this Paulides guy? He writes one helluva book. We recommend it highly. Most comments from readers who have seen a Bigfoot are raving on re: the human likenesses Harvey Pratt was able to capture in his sketches. Of course that is a feature I've been vocal about for thirteen years. --Bobby Short, Bigfoot News</p><h2>All-in-One Course for Children: Lesson, Theory, Solo, Book 4 (Alfred&#39;s Basic Piano Library)</h2><p>The &#34;All-in-One Course for Children&#34; takes all of the pages from &#34;Alfred&#39;s Basic Piano Library,&#34; Lesson Books 1A, 1B, and 2, plus selected pages from Theory, Recital and Fun Solo Books and combines them into part of a sequential five-book series.

Well advanced and consolidated from the first edition, more than anyone else Sheninger has integrated technology, learning, and change leadership. The seven pillars of learning are comprehensive. Leadership for quality implementation is captured beautifully. And the prominent positioning of efficacy and competencies nails impact. <em>Digital Leadership</em> is comprehensive for educators who want to advance learning with the latest know-how.</p> <br> -- Michael Fullan, Author, Professor Emeritus<br><br>If you were not an inspired leader and advocate for technology before reading this book you will be by the end of it.

Quaglia, Author, Executive Director<br><br><p>I&#x2019;m glad to see that Sheninger revisits <em>Digital Leadership</em> for a second time. There is great value in the fact that Eric looked at this topic through a lens of efficacy during this revisit. He focuses on the fact that it&#x2019;s not that educators are resistant to technology, but that they often don&#x2019;t have the confidence to keep up with the changing nature of it all, and Eric presents us all with a way to do that.</p> <br> -- Peter DeWitt, Author, Consultant<br><br><em>Digital Leadership</em> is quite simply a tour de force of a book. It is timely, relevant, and essential reading for those leading educational change within a fast and furious digital world. The book is fundamentally about learning and pedagogy rather than software or hardware. It is a manifesto for change in a digital age and is fundamentally concerned with using technology to enhance the learning outcomes and life chances of all students. It is a must read! -- Professor Alma Harris, Head of the School of Education<br><br>This book will equip leaders to model the skills, competencies, and pillars of <em>Digital Leadership </em>like never before. One of the biggest misnomers of this generation is the idea that leadership is an act of&nbsp;knowing.&nbsp;The thing that&#x2019;s truly missing in many schools is modeling.

As an administrator, I know how full our plate already is. This book helps simplify what YOU can do as a leader on your campus or in your district. The problem is our students today crave an environment that we struggle to provide. Sheninger provides a calming, thoughtful framework in <em>Digital Leadership</em>. Educators of all levels will benefit to his unlocking of a "solution" that combines where most districts are and where we should all strive to be. It is full of sound, relevant information that guides strategic thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and decision making&#x2015;all to the benefit of the ones we serve.

Since the first edition&#x2019;s release back in 2014, we&#x2019;ve seen changes in the digital landscape due to advances in technology. As school leaders, we must continue to adapt to these shifts in order to lead sustainable and meaningful change in our schools. As a highly acclaimed educator, leader, writer and speaker, Eric has dedicated his career to providing pedagogical frameworks, practical ideas, and real life examples that he has gathered from practitioners in the schools in which he serves. Regardless of your role in schools, I am confident you will find this second edition applicable to your work and inspire you to want to shift your practices as you continue to evolve as an educator. -- Jimmy Casas, Educator, Author, Speaker, Leadership Coach<br><br>The role of a leader isn&#x2019;t to tell others what to do. It&#x2019;s to show them what they can become. The world of education doesn&#x2019;t change annually, it changes daily. The digital connection to how we lead is an ever-changing landscape and one all leaders need to knows how to navigate. Creating leadership capacity in others moves the whole system. Eric Sheninger not only provides a pathway to get there, but he also provides the connections to move forward. The intersection of ISTE standards, Future Ready Frameworks, and organizational change makes this a must read for leaders in a changing world. -- Dr. Joe Sanfelippo, Author and Superintendent<br><br>Five years ago, Eric Sheninger cemented the importance of digital leadership at all levels of a school district. In the time since the first book&#x2019;s release, the 4th industrial revolution has continued to accelerate changes on the outside of the school walls. To remain relevant throughout this evolution, school leaders must work to create the learning experiences today&#x2019;s modern learners need to thrive in their future workforce. In this second edition, Sheninger solidifies his leadership pillars, through a refined underpinning of evidence and research, to ensure efficacy and deeper learning experiences, while avoiding the low level fluff that has pervaded the education space. If you want to ensure a return on instruction and work to create schools that are future ready, this book will be a foundational support for your journey. -- Thomas C. Murray, Director of Innovation<br><br>Eric Sheninger has done it again! As I read through the second edition of <em>Digital Leadership</em>, it was clear to me that the title of the book alone tells a very "compelling story." Eric is not one who simply studied digital leadership and then started consulting on it&#x2015;he walked digital leadership for years as a highly successful principal. He literally led his school digitally and resultantly the school experienced tremendous success. Through Digital Leadership, he has taken those strategies and infused them into this invaluable second edition. If you&nbsp; are in school leadership and you are looking for proven strategies toward successfully incorporating technology into your academic program, the second edition of<em> Digital Leadership</em> is your resource. -- Principal Baruti Kafele, Education Speaker, Consultant, Author</p><h2>Naruto, Vol. 37: Shikamaru&#39;s Battle</h2><p>Naruto is a ninja-in-training with a need for attention, a knack for mischief and, sealed within him, a strange, formidable power.<br><br>Reads R to L (Japanese Style).

How can we know if we are reading them the way God intended them to be read?</p><p>In this accessible guide, leading Old Testament scholar Peter Gentry identifies seven common characteristics of prophetic literature in the Bible that help us understand each book&#x2019;s message. With illustrations and clear examples, Gentry offers guidance for reading these challenging texts&#x2015;teaching us practical strategies for deeper engagement with the biblical text as we seek to apply God&#x2019;s Word to our lives today.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Peter J. Gentry</strong>&nbsp;(PhD, University of Toronto) is professor of Old Testament interpretation at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and director of the Hexapla Institute.</p><p>Donald L. Williams Professor of Old Testament, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; coauthor, <em>Kingdom through Covenant</em></p><p>&#x201c;When reading the Prophets, one may despair like the Ethiopian eunuch puzzling over Isaiah, &#x2018;How can I understand, unless someone guides me?&#x2019; Fortunately, Peter Gentry meets us on the road and asks, &#x2018;Do you understand what you are reading?&#x2019; Gentry ably guides us through this strange and foreign land.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Lindsay Kennedy,</strong> Assistant Pastor, Calvary Chapel Bothell, Bothell, Washington; blogger, <em>My Digital Seminary</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is just the book I was looking for! And why? To serve as an essential guide and resource text for my Lusaka Lutheran Seminary exegesis of Isaiah class. Gentry succeeds most admirably in his stated objective, which is to enable readers to read and understand the Prophets. And he does so in a way that is truly exemplary, employing a clear, concise, logically developed writing style that makes it relatively easy to probe this potentially difficult subject&#x2015;the Old Testament prophetic literature. The basic principles and procedures of text interpretation are given substance in many helpful reading strategies that are exemplified by some crucial biblical case studies&#x2015;primarily Isaiah, but also other prophetic texts that reflect upon the fundamental covenantal tenets of the Mosaic Torah, Deuteronomy in particular. All the key topics and tactics necessary for more effectively delving into the Prophets are introduced and amply illustrated: literary-stylistic cues, discourse structural markers, function of the foreign nations, Yahwist covenantal theology, biblical chronology and typology, and, of course, correctly discerning the future, including the apocalyptic genre. In short, the author demystifies the Hebrew prophets and successfully relates their writings also to hermeneutical issues facing the church today&#x2015;all in the space of less than 150 pages. This book would serve as a helpful introduction for adult Bible studies as well as college-level courses on hermeneutics. Scholars teaching at higher academic levels too would benefit from Gentry&#x2019;s excellent pedagogical approach. I had intended to complete my review of this book periodically, over the space of two weeks; however, once I got started, it took me only two days. Whether one happens to agree with the author&#x2019;s various interpretive conclusions or not (I do!), one must commend him for the careful manner in which he arrives at them. Many readers now will look forward to some sort of a teacher&#x2019;s guide (including various content and application questions) that could accompany this indispensable resource on the Hebrew prophets.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ernst R. Wendland,</strong>&nbsp;Instructor, Lusaka Lutheran Seminary, Zambia; Internal Examiner, University of Zambia</p><p>&#x201c;Having established a stellar reputation already through his many publications in Old Testament studies&#x2015;especially in Septuagint and biblical theology&#x2015;Gentry reflects broad expertise here in his treatment of prophetism as an institution and in the literary output of the canonical Prophets of the Hebrew Bible. This is more than &#x2018;just another book on the Prophets: their lives, times, and ministries.&#x2019; The approach in this case goes beyond the standard of the oeuvres already at hand. Gentry knits together most skillfully the strands of criticism, theology, history, poetry, apocalyptic, and pastoral practicality in a style that betrays at once solid scholarship and transparent readability.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Eugene H. Merrill,</strong> Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Old Testament Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;When traveling to a foreign land, the experience is so much richer when you have an experienced guide to explain the unique customs, point out things you might have missed, and take you to places you would not dare traverse alone. For modern Western readers of the Bible, the Prophets are a foreign land, even if we do not initially realize it. Peter Gentry, with his decades of experience traveling in this difficult terrain, can be your expert guide to the biblical Prophets through reading this book. I'm overjoyed that Gentry is sharing in print for a wider audience what I first found so helpful as class lectures a dozen years ago. Pick up this travel guide and experience the biblical Prophets afresh.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Richard Lucas</strong>, Biblical and Theological Studies Mentor, The NETS Center for Church Planting and Revitalization; Associate Pastor, Christ Memorial Church, Williston, Vermont</p><p>&#x201c;Peter Gentry is a master exegete and theologian, and in this brief volume he supplies excellent guidance for those of us who desire to read and understand the Prophets with greater biblical faithfulness. With clear prose and numerous examples, he identifies how we should approach the prophetic genre&#x2013;&#x2013;its grounding in the Mosaic covenant, its structure and use of repetition, its engagement of foreign nations, its use of typology and apocalyptic language, and its appropriation and already-but-not-yet fulfillment in the New Testament. Gentry helps us grasp how the prophets communicated their messages, and by doing so he empowers us to become better interpreters of God&#x2019;s Word. I highly recommend this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jason S. DeRouchie,</strong> Professor of Old Testament and Biblical Theology, Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary; Elder, Bethlehem Baptist Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota</p><p>&#x201c;Many people set out to read through the Bible but get bogged down in the Old Testament Prophets.

Mr. Mirocha lives in Tucson, Arizona.</p>Ages 5-8. Beginning with the events and effects of the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> disaster, Berger introduces children to the causes of oil spills, the ecological damage they cause, and the ideas and technologies developed to deal with them. Although the text is simple and clear, it's sometimes choppy: "Chemicals make the oil less harmful. But they add poisons to the water." Does cutting the sentence in two and treating the subordinate clause like a sentence really make it easier to read? Subtle in texture and deep in tone, the colorful artwork effectively illustrates marine animals and oil tankers; there are also diagrams of cleanup operations, maps, and fanciful ideas (the "1,000 big swimming pools" that could be filled with oil spilled from the <i>Exxon Valdez</i>). The book ends with suggestions for preventing oil spills, from conserving energy at home to writing letters to members of Congress requesting better oil transport legislation.

One of the most influential political treatises of all time, The Communist Manifesto is essential reading for every student of politics and history.</p><p>"A spectre is haunting Europe," Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, "the spectre of Communism." This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles."A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism." So begins one of history's most important documents, a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics, but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear, striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848, it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society "in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." <br>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. <br>This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces, and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions.</p><h2>AWS Certified Advanced Networking Official Study Guide: Specialty Exam</h2><p><p><b>The official study guide for the AWS certification specialty exam</b></p> <p>The <i>AWS Certified Advanced Networking Official Study Guide &#x2013; Specialty Exam</i> helps to ensure your preparation for the AWS Certified Advanced Networking <i>&#x2013; Specialty </i>Exam.

In a country that celebrates most special occasions with a coffee klatch that includes seven different kinds of cookies, this guide has served as a culinary bible. With more than 300 recipes &#x2014; many of which have been culled from bake-off contest winners&#x2014;the book is divided into categories like Sweet Breads, Rolls, Rusks and Cakes. Among the popular treats are the buttery wreath and pretzel-shaped cookies familiar to collectors of cookie tins; several variations on Danish pastry; puffy, raisin-studded saffron buns eaten around Christmas time; and Prinsesst�rta, an elaborate sponge, preserves, marzipan and cream confection typically found at the coffee klatch. Also included are several gluten-free, egg-free and sugar-free sweets. Though the recipes themselves are short on direction, tips for using the proper equipment and ingredients, and strategies for achieving the desired look and textures, are interspersed throughout. As many American readers have tried Swedish cuisine only at their local Ikea store, this cookbook provides a window to a celebratory culture and its many intriguing flavors. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the age of 40, he was a failing artist who struggled to sell a single painting. As he approached 80, Time magazine featured him on its cover. Today, half a century after his death, Hopper is considered a giant of modern expression, with an uncanny, unforgettable, and utterly distinct sense for mood and place.</p><p>Much of Hopper's work excavates modern city experience. In canvas after canvas, he depicts diners, cafes, shopfronts, street lights, gas stations, rail stations, and hotel rooms. The scenes are marked by vivid color juxtapositions and stark, theatrical lighting, as well as by harshly contoured figures, who appear at once part of, and alien to, their surroundings. The ambiance throughout his repertoire is of an eerie disquiet, alienation, loneliness and psychological tension, although his rural or coastal scenes can offer a counterpoint of tranquility or optimism.</p><p>This book presents key works from Hopper's &#x153;uvre to introduce a key player not only in American art history but also in the American psyche.</p></p><p>Rolf G.

From towering suspension bridges to humble stone crossings, this book visits them all in sweet, bouncing text with expository sidebars. But while bridges can be quite grand, this reminds us that their main purpose is bringing people together. This is perfect for budding architects, as well as readers who can relate to having loved ones who live far away.</p><p>Keely makes her children s book debut with a contemplative exploration of bridges, citing real-life examples, such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Peru s Puente de Piedra, and more metaphorical ones, including the arches created by backbends and rainbows. The straightforward central narrative ( Some bridges join country to country, making a big world seem smaller ) is supplemented by facts and details about the specific bridges that appear in Krampien s artwork ( The Three Countries Bridge at the borders of France, Germany, and Switzerland only truly connects France to Germany. But Switzerland is only a hop, skip, and a yodel away! ). In her first picture book, Krampien uses a fresh, contemporary cartooning style to create expansive panoramas that showcase the bridges sizes and spans, as well the activity of the humans and animals they serve particularly in the wildlife bridges of Banff National Park, which allow bears, wolves, and other creatures to cross highways safely. Keely s tender closing example of the bridge formed through the simple act of holding hands cements the message of togetherness and connection that bridges (of all kinds) make possible. Ages 5 8.

He grew up to become the father of organic architecture and the greatest American architect of all time, having designed more than 1,100 buildings during his lifetime. These included &nbsp;private homes &#x2013; such as the stunning Fallingwater, churches, temples, a hotel, and the world-famous Guggenheim Museum in New York City. &nbsp;When asked how he could create so many designs, he answered, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get them out fast enough.&#x201d; Frank Lloyd Wright was a man ahead of his time who could barely keep up with his own ideas!</p><p>Ellen Labrecque is a former Senior Editor for <i>Sports Illustrated for Kids</i> and the author of over twenty nonfiction books for young readers, including biographies of Jim Thorpe and Magic Johnson.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who Was Frank Lloyd Wright?<br> &nbsp;<br> For Frank Lincoln Wright&#x2019;s ninth birthday, his mother, Anna Lloyd Jones, bought him a special set of building blocks. The wooden blocks came in many shapes and sizes: cubes, spheres, and pyramids. There were shiny papers to cover them, and sticks to connect them.<br> &nbsp;<br> On that day in 1876, Anna dreamed her son would grow up to be a famous architect. An architect is a person who designs buildings such as homes, schools, hospitals, and museums. An architect plans what a building will look like inside and out. He also makes sure it is built safely.<br> &nbsp;<br> Frank loved his new toys and played with them all day long. He learned how shapes fit together. And he learned that he could make bigger and bigger structures by putting smaller shapes together in the right order.<br> &nbsp;<br> During Frank&#x2019;s long life, he designed more than 1,100 buildings, including small houses, giant mansions, churches, temples, office buildings, and even a world-famous museum. When asked how he could create so many new projects, Frank answered, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get them out fast enough.&#x201d; He could barely keep up with his own ideas!<br> &nbsp;<br> Frank&#x2019;s ideas led to some of the most creative structures ever built. He designed a house in Pennsylvania called Fallingwater that sits on top of a waterfall! He constructed an office building in Wisconsin that has columns shaped like giant lily pads at the top. He designed the Guggenheim art museum in New York City&#x2014;a building that looks like a giant teacup from the outside. Inside, a spiral ramp rises toward a domed skylight.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1991, the American Institute of Architects declared Frank &#x201c;the greatest American architect of all time.&#x201d; He really did become one of the world&#x2019;s best architects.

In a conversational tone with rich vocabulary, the text discusses considerations in creating the projects and encourages a variety of texture and effect through the use of color, contrast, shape, and size. "Art Notes" provide tidbits of peripheral advice for simplifying the projects. The book concludes with step-by-step how-to information for readers to assemble their own masterpieces, an explanation and diagram of the life cycle of a leaf, and a simple field guide that identifies the samples used in the models.

Bauer, USN (ret.)</b>, is a professional navigator and master mariner with the U.S. Merchant Marine. He presently commands a Navy research vessel sailing between the United States and the Caribbean islands and recently commanded the ship that was successful in relocating the historic sunken submarine <i>Monitor</i> off Cape Hatteras. A former destroyer captain, Cmdr. Bauer has taught radar and been a senior instructor for the Master Mates and Pilots School of Advanced Studies and also served as the commander of the Naval Research Lab at Chesapeake Beach, Maryland. In addition to <i>The Sextant Handbook</i>, Cmdr. Bauer has written articles on the subject of marine sextants for <i>Cruising World</i> and <i>SAIL</i> magazines. He lives with his artist wife, Nancy, on the shores of the Chesapeake in Deale, Maryland.<p>"The wealth of useful material is prodigious and by the time one has reached the back cover, the sextant is an old friend. Just as important, Cdr. Bauer deals comprehensively with maintenance and service, and his advice on how to select and assess a second-hand sextant is truly worthwhile. Refreshingly, he writes in a friendly manner--almost as though he is chatting to a group of students. A thoroughly enjoyable book."--Peter Milne, Technical Editor, <i>Yachting World Magazine</i> (England)</p><p>"If this book is a highly detailed technical manual, the reader is hardly aware, so plentiful are the diversions into related topics. It makes great reading and virtually everyone . . . regardless of one's skill level with a sextant . . . will find new things to learn about sextants, their history, their future and their best use."--<i>Ocean Navigator</i></p><p>"The sextant and Commander Bauer's handbook should be standard equipment on every seagoing vessel. It is a book that should be provided with every sextant and class in navigating."--R. J. Holt, Director, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum</p><p>"One recognizes here a centennial Lecky on the sextant. There is plenty of new material presented in a manner that would make a stranger want to meet Bruce Bauer and converse with him face to face."--Paul M. Anderton, Navigation Instructor</p><p>"Cdr. Bauer's book will become a standard reference on the sextant for professional and amateur navigators around the world. I have been doing celestial navigation since 1953 and have not, until now, been able to find so much information on the sextant collected in one place."--A. W. Fowler, Ocean Racing Navigator</p><p>"Bauer has succeeded in gathering a wealth of information from a multitude of sources and brought it all together into a fascinating book for the mariner. I recommend it to those who navigate the ocean's highways."--Warren P. Davis, Colonel, USA (Ret.), Sextant Authority</p><p>"Insecurity is sitting on a boat in the middle of the ocean staring at an out-of-whack sextant and not knowing how to fix it. I know from experience. This book should be mandatory equipment on every boat that goes offshore."--Wayne Carpenter, Author, <i>The Voyage of Kristina</i></p></p><h2>Cold Times: How to Prepare for the Mini Ice Age</h2><p>No holds barred guidebook to surviving the coming Mini Ice Age.

GRADE 6</b><br> What do you want me to say? My name? Again? Don't you have it from the first time? Okay, I'm Sam Dawkins, but everybody calls me Snikwad, or Snik, on account of that's my name spelled backward. It's a snikname. Get it? </p><p> Do we really have to go through this whole thing all over again? I mean, sometimes freak accidents just happen. There's nothing you can do about it. Nobody means for them to happen. They just do. It just did. We're all sorry it happened. If any of us had known what was going to happen, we never would have done any of it. Can I go home now? I really don't like being here. </p><p> <b>JUDY DOUGLAS. GRADE 6</b><br> I can't believe I'm sitting in this room again. I want you to know that this is just the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me in my entire life. I'm not a criminal! It was an accident. We're sorry. None of us knew it was going to get out of control, I swear! I have worked so hard all my life to get good grades and sign up for lots of extracurricular activities and go to church and always do the right thing. I have been on the Principal's List every marking period since second grade. I'm not talking about the honor roll, where you can get Bs on your report card. The Principal's List! That's straight As. And now this happens...again! It makes me question why I try so hard to be good. I mean, really, what's the reward? If this keeps me out of the Ivy League, my mom will never let me forget it. </p><p> <b>JUDY'S MOM</b><br> I assure you, my daughter will <i>never</i> be involved with anything like this again. Not if I have anything to say about it. I teach my children to learn from their mistakes. She is on permanent probation. </p><p> <b>KELSEY DONNELLY. GRADE 6</b><br> We are all really sorry. I'm not just saying that because we're in trouble. We really felt terrible about what happened. It was just one of those freak accidents. Do I really have to tell the whole story from the beginning? Okay. </p><p> I have to confess, it was kinda cool seeing my picture in the paper the first time and everything. Y'know? Even if it was because we got caught heaving the homework machine into the Grand Canyon. It was even mentioned on <i>The Today Show</i>! Can you believe that? We were a little famous for a while. We had our fifteen minutes. </p><p> I mean, don't get me wrong. I felt bad and all because what we did was wrong. But you can't help but get a little tingle when you see your picture in the paper. I cut it out and put it in my scrapbook. </p><p> But this...this is getting old. I promise you won't see me in here again. I promise. </p><p> <b>BRENTON DAMAGATCHI. GRADE 6</b><br> First let me say it was all my fault. The others were there, of course. But I built the machine in the first place. I have to take responsibility for anything that was done with it. </p><p> I wonder if it might be possible to invent a time machine. I have no desire to go to the past or future, personally. But if one had a time machine, anytime you made a mistake in life, you could just go back a few seconds and erase it. Just like the eraser on a pencil. Do it over. Then you would never make any mistakes. You would be perfect. Except, I suppose, for the mistakes you don't know about. You can't fix a mistake if you don't even know that you made one. </p><p> May I have a drink of water? Thanks. </p><p> <b>RONNIE TEOTWAWKI. GRADE 6</b><br> You wanna know what I thought about the whole thing? I'll be honest. I thought it was great that Brenton, Snik, Judy, and Kelsey got caught throwing their homework machine into the canyon. What a dumb thing to do! And people always say <i>I</i> use bad judgment! It served 'em right. That's how I felt. I laughed all day. </p><p> Of course, this is a different story. I was involved. I admit it. If you need to throw me in reform school or something, well, I guess I deserve it. </p><p> <b>MISS RASMUSSEN. FIFTH-GRADE TEACHER</b><br> They are all good kids. They really are. I felt partly responsible for the first mess because it happened on my watch. I was a first-year teacher at the time. If I had been more experienced, I probably would have noticed that their homework was so similar. I might have figured out that they were using a machine to do it for them. Ah, but you live and learn, right? </p><p> <b>JUDY DOUGLAS. GRADE 6</b><br> You want to go all the way back to September? Okay. Well, that's my favorite time of year because the tourists have gone home. The leaves fall from the trees. It's quiet around the canyon and you don't have traffic jams and RVs all over and people everywhere with cameras and coolers. We have the Grand Canyon all to ourselves, it seems. It's like our backyard. I think we take it for granted. Sometimes I'm out with my mom in the car and we don't even look into the canyon. I've heard that people who live in New York City never even visit the Statue of Liberty. If I lived in New York, I'd be there every day! </p><p> <b>KELSEY DONNELLY. GRADE 6</b><br> A lot of kids are here in the summer, but they're just tourists. There aren't many kids who live around here, which kinda sucks because you just see the same old faces day after day after day. It's boring. Our school is small. Everybody knows what everybody else is up to. So you do one silly thing like dye your hair and it's, like, front-page news. I bet if I lived in a big city, nobody would even notice me. </p><p> We have only one sixth-grade class, so the four of us were together again. They wouldn't let us sit together, though. Oh no, they weren't about to make <i>that</i> mistake a second time. </p><p> <b>MR. MURPHY. SIXTH-GRADE TEACHER</b><br> It's a shame what happened. That's all I can say. Take it all the way back to the beginning? Okay. </p><p> I'm retired United States Air Force, and I worked on the space program at NASA for many years. I guess I was just drawn to the canyon, like a lot of people. You know, one of the seven wonders of the world, and all that. I used to go rafting out here on the Colorado River in my younger days. </p><p> My wife and I moved from Houston to retire, but I couldn't stand doing nothing. I started hanging around the library, researching strange things that happened at the Grand Canyon. I thought maybe I'd write a book on the topic. But I'm the restless type. Can't sit still. So I went to school and took a few classes so I could get a teaching certificate. </p><p> The kids say I'm strict because I don't tolerate any foolishness. I suppose that's why I was hired. They wanted somebody who could keep the class in order, especially after what happened with those four. An authority figure, y'know? A military guy who would keep them in line. </p><p> But what happened, happened. I'm partly responsible, because I was there. I will never forget it. I feel deeply sorry about it. </p><p> <b>SAM DAWKINS. GRADE 6</b><br> Mr. Murphy looked like one of those drill sergeants you see in the movies. You know, he has a crew cut you could balance a soda can on. When he walked into the class for the first time in September, I thought we'd all have to snap to attention or start marching around the playground. I was afraid he was gonna take one look at my long hair and suspend me for life. </p><p> But my dad was in the military, so I'm used to guys like that. Mr. Murphy is cool, in a way. You know where you stand with him. He doesn't say one thing and mean something else, like a lot of other guys. If he's mad, he tells you. And if you do something good, he tells you that, too. </p><p> <b>JUDY DOUGLAS. GRADE 6</b><br> Mr. Murphy told us that he actually met Neil Armstrong, John Glenn, and all those other astronauts when he was working at NASA. Can you imagine? And here he was, teaching us. It was pretty neat, to think that there was just one degree of separation between me and the first man to walk on the moon. </p><p> <b>KELSEY DONNELLY. GRADE 6</b><br> Yeah, when we came back to school in September, we knew we would have to go back to doing our homework the old-fashioned way -- with pencils and papers and our brains. Ha! What a drag. I missed the homework machine. It was just so easy, sliding a work sheet into the computer and having your homework pop out of the printer a few minutes later -- finished, perfect, and even in my own handwriting! Man, that was great. I'm sure Snik missed having the homework machine around too. It probably didn't matter much to Brenton and Judy one way or the other, because they're geniuses anyway. I think they actually <i>like</i> doing homework. They're freaks. </p><p> <b>SAM DAWKINS. GRADE 6</b><br> I <i>still</i> hate homework. What a waste of time! But what are you gonna do? Kids don't rule the world. We've got no power. </p><p> <b>MR. MURPHY. SIXTH-GRADE TEACHER</b><br> Let me see, what did we learn this year? Dividing by decimals. That was interesting. I had completely forgotten how to do it without a calculator. I had to learn all over again. I taught the kids the parts of speech too. A lot of kids have trouble with adverbs and adjectives. I like to tell them that it was a lot easier when I was their age -- there were only three parts of speech back then. American history was a lot easier to memorize too, because there were only thirteen states. Sometimes the kids don't get my jokes. </p><p> <b>SAM DAWKINS. GRADE 6</b><br> Mr. Murphy is pretty funny, for an old guy with a crew cut. He would let us joke around with him a little. But you had to be careful. If you crossed the line, he'd cut you down with a stare and let you know it was time to knock it off. </p><p> <b>MR. MURPHY. SIXTH-GRADE TEACHER</b><br> And of course in the sixth grade, we teach about ancient civilizations -- Egypt, the Aztecs, the Mayans, and the ancient Americans, too. The kids always joke that I know so much about that stuff because I lived through it. They crack me up. </p><p> <b>JUDY DOUGLAS. GRADE 6</b><br> I found the history of the Grand Canyon to be fascinating. We think of this area as just a tourist attraction, but for more than ten thousand years, people <i>lived</i> right in the canyon!

One of the most important safeguards against all forms of heresy is a robust appreciation for biblical theology&#x2015;reading the Bible in a way that takes into account the whole storyline of redemptive history. Exhorting pastors and other church leaders to prioritize biblical theology in their own congregations, this book explains basic principles for reading the Bible that help pastors teach the big story of the Bible from every text. Understanding the Bible in Christ-centered terms shapes the church's teaching and mission, and protects the truth of the gospel around the world.</p></p><p><p><strong>Nick Roark</strong> (MDiv, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary) serves as the pastor of Franconia Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia.

Nick Roark and Robert Cline show how biblical theology is essential for the church, for preaching, and for living. They survey the big picture of the Scriptures and show us some wrong turns that are commonly made. A very helpful resource for pastors, teachers, and laypeople.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thomas R. Schreiner,</strong> James Buchanan Harrison Professor of New Testament Interpretation, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;I love biblical theology, but I don&#x2019;t always love biblical theology books. Too often, they are so technically written that they miss the majority of believers. This book is an exception. The authors not only define, defend, and describe biblical theology but also do so in a way that is accessible to all believers. This book is simple while addressing complex ideas, short but packed with information, and theoretical yet filled with practical examples of doing biblical theology. It is both a call to do biblical theology and a handbook for doing it well. I finished it with a deeper desire to see Jesus in the Word and to help my church members do the same.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Chuck Lawless,</strong> Dean of Doctoral Studies and Vice President for Spiritual Formation, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary; author, <em>Spiritual Warfare: Biblical Truth for Victory</em> and <em>Putting on the Armor</em></p><p>&#x201c;There is not a single effective biblical expositor today who does not employ biblical theology to make sense of his text and to deliver its Christ-centered message.

The authors have done us all a great favor by distilling heavy biblical concepts and making them simple, user-friendly, and transferable. This is the kind of book you want to hand out to a Sunday school teacher, an aspiring pastor, or a missionary candidate. Well-meaning Bible teachers often take the easy path of proof texting to make a &#x2018;practical lesson,&#x2019; but miss the larger theme, the glorious centerpiece of the passage. A wonderful tool for keeping me on track as a missionary and for teaching new converts how to study and teach the Word, this small book should be translated into many languages!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David L. Frazier,</strong> Executive Director, Equipping Servants International; author, <em>Mission Smart</em></p><p>&#x201c;This brief book explains important theological concepts in a clear, faithful, simple way. It is perfect for those in the church who might find an in-depth academic book a challenge, but who want to understand sound theology and grasp the biblical concepts needed in order to teach the gospel well. This is an excellent resource, and I can&#x2019;t wait to recommend it to my women&#x2019;s ministry team.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Abi Byrd,</strong> former missionary to the Balkans; Bible Instructor, The Simeon Trust; Deacon of Women&#x2019;s Ministry, Loudoun Valley Baptist Church, Purcellville, Virginia</p><p>&#x201c;A believer is measured by faithfulness, and it is imperative that a believer know how to be faithful to the Word of God, our one timeless authority. Through explanation and example, Nick and Robert&#x2019;s book simply and helpfully instructs believers on how to rightly understand individual biblical passages while always keeping in mind the big picture that Christ is the goal and end of all Scripture.

If you are looking for a resource that explains and applies biblical theology well, this is your book. It is biblical, well written, easy to understand, practical, brief yet not superficial, full of information, and extremely helpful for preaching and pastoral ministry.

Biblical theology is a critical tool to help Christians protect and proclaim the gospel. I am immensely grateful for this book and excited to see it used to strengthen the global church. It strikes the perfect balance of breadth and depth, easily translates across cultural and language backgrounds, and will help all Christians better see, celebrate, and communicate the gospel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Andrew Gizinski,</strong> Elder, RAK Evangelical Church, Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates</p><p>&#x201c;Nick and Robert have accomplished something rare in a field this broad. They have succinctly clarified the core of biblical theology without oversimplifying the process.

Read this book and see for yourself! The phrase <i>biblical theology</i> may give you the impression that this is a textbook only for Bible colleges or pastoral training. But here is a must-read book for every Christian because we are all meant to be stewards of the church of Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Conrad Mbewe,</strong> Pastor, Kabwata Baptist Church; Chancellor, African Christian University, Lusaka, Zambia</p><p>&#x201c;Trying to put together the various historical epochs and literary genres of the sixty-six books of Scripture into one consistent whole can seem like a daunting task. In this eminently readable and practical book, Roark and Cline help us to see that this difficult task might not be so hard after all; for, as Jesus says, all Scripture points to him. The authors are to be commended for writing a book to help Bible teacher and student alike to understand the point of God&#x2019;s Word and protect us from applying it in wrong ways to our lives and our churches.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Shawn D.

It is so important that it provides the fundamental underpinning of all modern sciences. Without it, we&#39;d have no nuclear power or nuclear weapons, no TV, no computers, no science of molecular biology, no understanding of DNA, no genetic engineering. In Search of Schrodinger&#39;s Cat tells the complete story of quantum mechanics, a truth stranger than any fiction. John Gribbin takes us step by step into an ever more bizarre and fascinating place, requiring only that we approach it with an open mind. He introduces the scientists who developed quantum theory. He investigates the atom, radiation, time travel, the birth of the universe, superconductors and life itself. And in a world full of its own delights, mysteries and surprises, he searches for Schrodinger&#39;s Cat - a search for quantum reality - as he brings every reader to a clear understanding of the most important area of scientific study today - quantum physics. In Search of Schrodinger&#39;s Cat is a fascinating and delightful introduction to the strange world of the quantum - an essential element in understanding today&#39;s world.</p><p>Part history book and part remedial physics text for those who lost interest when the equations started getting unintuitive, <i>In Search of Schr�dinger's Cat</i> explains quantum physics in a way that's not only clear, but also enjoyable.<p> Gribbin opens with the subjects that most physics professors have just started to examine at the end of the semester: The mysterious character of light, the valence concept in Nils Bohr's atomic model, radioactive decay, and the physics of life-defining DNA all get clear, comprehensive, and witty coverage. This book reveals the beauty and mystery that underlies everything in the universe.</p><p> Does this book claim to explain quantum physics without math? No. Math is too central to physics to be bypassed. But if you can do basic algebra, you can understand the equations in <i>In Search of Schr�dinger's Cat</i>. Gribbin is the physics teacher everyone should have in high school or college: kind without being a pushover, knowledgeable without being condescending, and clearly expressive without being boring. Gribbin's book belongs on the shelf of every pre-calculus student. It also deserves a place in the library of everyone who was scared away from advanced physics prematurely.</p>John Gribbin&#39;s books include The Hole in the Sky, a survey of the destruction of the ozone layer, and Hothouse Earth, a study of the greenhouse effect. He has written regularly for The Times and the Guardian, and is physics consultant for the New Scientist. He also broadcasts for the BBC World Service and is occasionally adviser for television documentaries.

And who but Quentin Blake could make the most poignant of stories so lighthearted and delightful? In this episodic picture book by an inimitable author-illustrator duo, a fantastic chain of events is triggered by the unacknowledged fall of a marzipan pig behind the sofa. We meet in quick succession a heartsick mouse, a lonely grandfather clock, an owl in love with a taxi meter, a worker bee, a fading hibiscus flower, a mouse who greets the dawn dancing, and finally a boy who guesses at the true relations between things. Appealing to the unsentimental yet sensitive nature of children, <i>The Marzipan Pig</i> is exquisitely attuned to the bittersweet wonder of life and to the sentience of all beings.</p><p><b>Russell Hoban</b> (1925&#x2013;2011) was the author of more than seventy books for children and adults. He worked as a commercial artist and advertising copywriter before embarking on a career as a children&#x2019;s author while in his early thirties. During the 1960s Hoban and his wife, Lillian, worked at a prodigious rate, producing as many as six books in a single year, including <i>The Sorely Trying</i> <i>Day </i>(published by The New York Review Children&#x2019;s Collection). Among Hoban&#x2019;s novels for adults are <i>Turtle Diary </i>(published by NYRB Classics), <i>Riddley Walker</i>, <i>The Bat Tattoo</i>, and <i>My Tango</i> <i>with Barbara Strozzi</i>. He lived in London from 1969 until his death. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Quentin Blake</b> is one of the most celebrated children&#x2019;s book illustrators working today, having illustrated more than three hundred books by such authors as Russell Hoban, Joan Aiken, and Roald Dahl. A prolific writer of books for children himself, Blake was appointed the first Children&#x2019;s Laureate of England in 1999.&#x201c;Children&#x2014;the least sentimental beings on this planet&#x2014;will recognize this remarkable book for what it is, a story about the great sweet mysteries of love and mortality.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kathryn Davis&nbsp;<br><br>"Hoban gives each [character] here an individual personality, grounding the story so that what might have been bizarre or pretentious is matter-of-fact and affecting. Blake's watercolors are understated yet so expressive they make an owl's love for the glowing light of a taxi meter or a worker bee's kindness to a dying hibiscus flower entirely believable." &#x2014;Martha V. Parravano<br><br>"Each new turn is the occasion for some entertaining repartee as well as implicit ruminations on love between two beings that may not share a language or seem to communicate. This is all more accessible and fun than it may sound in summary. Hoban's deft, poetic style is perfect for sharing aloud; Blake's many humorous illustrations (black-and-white and thus more subdued than usual) enliven the attractive format. A good choice for young readers who enjoy fantasy." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"Exploring the same themes of love and its redeeming power as in The Mouse and His Child, Hoban incorporates humor and adventure in this short, fable-like story. Blake's charcoal-and-ink drawings charmingly illuminate the text." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Sigils, Ciphers and Scripts</h2><p>Concisely written and richly illustrated, Magic Writing is a most accessible and informative book on the occult history and graphic origins of the signs, symbols, scripts and ciphers of Western Occultism.

These unique expressions of Truth are both a celebration of life and an invitation to the deep and joyful surrender into the Self. Although awakened in the Zen tradition, his teachings spring spontaneously from emptiness, free of any tradition or ideology, and touch the heart in the tradition of the great mystic poets, Rumi and Hafiz.</p><p>After 15 years of Zen practice and a series of ever-deepening realizations, this direct, loving and engaging modern teacher began to offer dharma talks, weekend programs and retreats in 1996. Known for his clarity, wisdom and rich humor he has a rapidly expanding base of students, many of whom have awakened to their true nature in his presence. His teachings have been compared to those of the early Zen masters, and the wisdom teachings of Advaita Vedanta, and speak deeply to all seekers of Truth.</p><h2>The Republic: Introduction by Alexander Nehamas (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics Series)</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Toward the end of the astonishing period of Athenian creativity that furnished Western civilization with the greater part of its intellectual, artistic, and political wealth, Plato wrote <i>The Republic</i>, his discussion of the nature and meaning of justice and of the ideal state and its ruler. All subsequent European thinking about these subjects owes its character, directly or indirectly, to this most famous (and most accessible) of the Platonic dialogues. Although he describes a society that looks to some like the ideal human community and to others like a totalitarian nightmare, in the course of his description Plato raises enduringly relevant questions about politics, art, education, and the general conduct of life.&nbsp; The translation is by A.

Like his mentor Socrates, he was essentially a practical philosopher who found the abstract theory and visionary schemes of many contemporary thinkers misguided and sterile. He was born about 429 B.C. in Athens, the son of a prominent family that had long been involved in the city's politics. Extremely little survives of the history of Plato's youth, but he was raised in the shadow of the great Peloponnesian War, and its influence must have caused him to reject the political career open to him and to become a follower of the brilliantly unorthodox Socrates, the self-proclaimed "gadfly" of Athens.<br><br>Socrates' death in 399 B.C. turned Plato forever from politics, and in the next decade he wrote his first dialogues, among them Apology and Euthyphro. At age forty, Plato visited Italy and Syracuse, and upon his return he founded the Academy-Europe's first university-in a sacred park on the outskirts of Athens. The Academy survived for a millennium, finally closed by the emperor Justinian in A.D. 529. Plato hoped his school would train its pupils to carry out a life of service and to investigate questions of science and mathematics. Plato's old age was probably devoted to teaching and writing, he died in Athens in 348 B.C.</p><h2>Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level</h2><p><p><strong>NOTE: This book will not include an access code. </strong><br></p> <p><br></p> <p>Voet, Voet and Pratt&#x2019;s Fundamentals of Biochemistry, 5e addresses the enormous advances in biochemistry, particularly in the areas of structural biology and Bioinformatics, by providing a solid biochemical foundation that is rooted in chemistry to prepare students for the scientific challenges of the future.&nbsp; While continuing in its tradition of presenting complete and balanced coverage that is clearly written and relevant to human health and disease, Fundamentals of Biochemistry, 5e includes new pedagogy and enhanced visuals that provide a pathway for student learning.</p> <p>The authors are careful to present new information such that it links it to existing content, ever mindful that students assimilate new information only in the proper context.

Richter and Frances Burke update this essential staple to delve deeply into the unique ethical problems of twenty-first century public administration. Wide-ranging readings from Aristotle and Kant to John Kennedy and John T. Noonan provide initiation into the philosophical basis of ethics as virtue, consequence, principle, and responsibility, while new case studies drawn from today&#39;s headlines join old classics from the previous edition to help students apply ethical foundations to a modern administrative career. New chapters on privacy, secrecy, and confidentiality and the changing boundaries of public administration consider the consequences of computerization and globalization, two of this century&#39;s greatest challenges. By seamlessly melding theory with practice, Richter and Burke have created a key resource in educating future public administrators on the ethical problems associated with corruption, deception, evasion of accountability, and the abuse of authority. Open-ended examples and discussion questions encourage students to understand the complexity of administrative ethics and the need for careful thought in their day-to-day decisions. Combating Corruption, Encouraging Ethics offers both the depth demanded by graduate courses in administrative ethics and the accessibility necessary for an undergraduate introduction to public administration.</p><p>William L.

(<i>Forum</i>)<br><br>Burke and Richter, in revising their first edition of <i>Combating Corruption, Encouraging Ethics</i>, have put together a first-rate compendium of ethical and moral insights. They juxtapose classical analyses of virtue and prudent public behavior with contemporary problems in a way that encourages students to engage these important ethical issues. The issues they raise in the text are as old as Aristotle and as new as 9/11, and the carefully chosen scholarly analyses and case studies challenge students to think for themselves.

Court-ordered monetary sanctions that compel criminal defendants to pay fines, fees, surcharges, and restitution further inhibit their ability to reenter society. In <i>A Pound of Flesh</i>, sociologist Alexes Harris analyzes the rise of monetary sanctions in the criminal justice system and shows how they permanently penalize and marginalize the poor. She exposes the damaging effects of a little-understood component of criminal sentencing and shows how it further perpetuates racial and economic inequality.</p> <p>Harris draws from extensive sentencing data, legal documents, observations of court hearings, and interviews with defendants, judges, prosecutors, and other court officials. She documents how low-income defendants are affected by monetary sanctions, which include fees for public defenders and a variety of processing charges. Until these debts are paid in full, individuals remain under judicial supervision, subject to court summons, warrants, and jail stays. As a result of interest and surcharges that accumulate on unpaid financial penalties, these monetary sanctions often become insurmountable legal debts which many offenders carry for the remainder of their lives. Harris finds that such fiscal sentences, which are imposed disproportionately on low-income minorities, help create a permanent economic underclass and deepen social stratification.</p> <p>A Pound of Flesh delves into the court practices of five counties in Washington State to illustrate the ways in which subjective sentencing shapes the practice of monetary sanctions. Judges and court clerks hold a considerable degree of discretion in the sentencing and monitoring of monetary sanctions and rely on individual values&#x2014;such as personal responsibility, meritocracy, and paternalism&#x2014;to determine how much and when offenders should pay. Harris shows that monetary sanctions are imposed at different rates across jurisdictions, with little or no state government oversight. Local officials&#x2019; reliance on their own values and beliefs can also push offenders further into debt&#x2014;for example, when judges charge defendants who lack the means to pay their fines with contempt of court and penalize them with additional fines or jail time.</p> <p><i>A Pound of Flesh</i> provides a timely examination of how monetary sanctions permanently bind poor offenders to the judicial system. Harris concludes that in letting monetary sanctions go unchecked, we have created a two-tiered legal system that imposes additional burdens on already-marginalized groups.</p> <p></p></p><p>ALEXES HARRIS is associate professor of sociology at the University of Washington.<p>&#x201c;<i>A Pound of Flesh</i> is a critical and timely book on a great contemporary American injustice: the imposition of legal fines and fees through the criminal courts. Alexes Harris&#x2019; pioneering research documents the widespread practice of charging fines and fees to people who have contact with the criminal justice system&#x2014;including some who are never convicted of a crime. The imposition of fines and fees creates a two-tiered legal system that separates those who have the ability to pay from those who don&#x2019;t. Through careful fieldwork and revealing interviews, Harris shows how judges and court clerks use fines and fees to punish poor people in unequal and enduring ways. Even small amounts of legal debt can be insurmountable obstacles for people living on the margins. <i>A Pound of Flesh</i> is a revolutionary book that has already made an impact on the national policy conversation. It provides an eye-opening account of how the American legal system shapes inequality and how inequality impacts access to justice.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2014;Becky Pettit</b>, professor of sociology, The University of Texas at Austin</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>A Pound of Flesh</i> is a rich and disturbing account of the new administrative penology that has seeped into every corner of contemporary criminal justice. Alexes Harris uses a full analytic toolkit to show the structure of legal financial obligations that have eclipsed the traditional adjudication role of the courts. Everyone pays, both the guilty and the innocent. Her chilling account reveals the strong embrace of these fines and fees&#x2014;a regime of defendant taxation&#x2014;in the everyday culture of criminal justice. Harris sounds an alarm for those who place the principles of due process above the power of the administrative state.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2014;Jeffrey Fagan</b>, Isidor and Seville Sulzbacher Professor of Law, Columbia Law School</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Until recently, monetary sanctions remained a largely hidden element of the criminal justice system. Alexes Harris exposes the costs and consequences of these sanctions through a detailed and far-reaching examination. Drawing on legal precedent, state practices, and in-depth interviews, Harris uncovers the unique penalties faced by the poor in encounters with the criminal justice system, as unpayable legal debt becomes a source of permanent punishment. <i>A Pound of Flesh</i> is a must read for those interested in punishment and inequality in America.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2014;Devah Pager</b>, professor of sociology and public policy,John F.

That&#x2019;s water, and I&#x2019;m thirsty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re thirsty,&#x201d; said Umbo.<br> <br>&#x201c;You cannot drink there,&#x201d; said the expendable.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cannot? There&#x2019;s some kind of danger?&#x201d; asked Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or a law,&#x201d; suggested Olivenko.<br> <br>&#x201c;You said you were leading us to water,&#x201d; said Loaf, &#x201c;and there it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the water I&#x2019;m taking you to,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>Only now did Rigg realize what he wasn&#x2019;t seeing. It was his inborn gift that all the paths of the past were visible to him. Humans and animals all left traces behind them, paths in time. If they ever traveled through a particular place, Rigg could tell where they had gone. It was not something he saw with his eyes&#x2014;his eyes could be closed or covered, or there could be walls or solid rock between him and a path, and he would still know where it was, and could figure out what kind of creature made it, and how long ago.<br> <br>There had been no human traffic at this stream in ten thousand years. More tellingly, few animals had come there, and no large ones.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s poisonous,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that a guess?&#x201d; asked his sister, Param, &#x201c;or do you know somehow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Even animals don&#x2019;t come here to drink,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;And no human for a long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long?&#x201d; asked Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know?&#x201d; asked Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m curious about what you know,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;I have not known a human who can do what you can do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nearly as long as since the beginning of human settlement on this world.&#x201d; Rigg had a very clear idea of what paths that old were like, since he had just crossed through the Wall between his home wallfold and this one, by clinging to an animal that, in the original stream of time, had died in the holocaust of humans&#x2019; first coming to the planet Garden.<br> <br>&#x201c;That is off by only a little less than a thousand years,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;I said &#x2018;nearly,&#x2019;&#x201d; answered Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;A thousand years this way or that,&#x201d; said Param. &#x201c;Close enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rigg still didn&#x2019;t know Param well enough to tell if her sarcasm was friendly teasing or open scorn. &#x201c;What kind of poison?&#x201d; he asked Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;A parasite,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;It can live out its entire lifecycle in the stream feeding off the bodies of its siblings, ancestors, and descendants, until one of them eats it. But if a larger animal comes to drink, it attaches to the face and immediately sends tendrils into the brain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It eats brains?&#x201d; asked Umbo, intrigued.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;It infiltrates them. It echoes the neural network. It takes over and controls the host&#x2019;s behavior.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why in the world would our ancestors bring along such a creature when they came from Earth?&#x201d; asked Umbo.<br> <br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Olivenko.<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you know that?&#x201d; asked Loaf. His tone showed he was still skeptical of Olivenko, who was only a member of the city guard in Aressa Sessamo, rather than a real soldier.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because if they had, it would exist in every wallfold,&#x201d; said Olivenko, &#x201c;and it doesn&#x2019;t exist in ours.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivenko thinks the way Father taught me, thought Rigg. Don&#x2019;t assume: Think it through.<br> <br>Vadesh was nodding. &#x201c;A very tough little creature, the facemask.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Facemask?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What the humans of this wallfold named it. For reasons that would have become tragically obvious if you had bent over to drink from the stream.&#x201d;<br> <br>Something didn&#x2019;t ring true about this. &#x201c;How can a creature that evolved on Garden successfully take over the brains of creatures from Earth?&#x201d; asked Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say it was successful,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;And you are now as close as is safe. To avoid picking up facemasks from the wet ground beside the stream&#x2014;they can attach to any skin and migrate up your body&#x2014;you should follow in my footsteps exactly.&#x201d;<br> <br>They followed him in single file through the grass, with Rigg bringing up the rear. The path Vadesh took them on was the highest ground. Each time they reached a damp patch they jumped over it. The rill was narrow here. No one had trouble overleaping it.<br> <br>Only when they got to higher ground several rods beyond the rill was Rigg able to continue the conversation. &#x201c;If the parasite wasn&#x2019;t successful, why is it still alive here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The parasite is successful in attaching to humans and Earthborn beasts of all kinds,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not really how we measure success in a parasite. If the parasite kills its host too quickly, for instance, before the parasite can spread to new hosts, then it has failed. The goal of a parasite is like that of any other life form&#x2014;to survive and reproduce.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So these facemasks kill too quickly?&#x201d; asked Umbo, shuddering.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;I said &#x2018;for instance.&#x2019;&#x201d; He smiled at Rigg, because they both knew he was echoing Rigg&#x2019;s earlier testy reply when Vadesh told him his time estimate was off by a millennium.<br> <br>&#x201c;So in what way did this parasite fail?&#x201d; asked Rigg&#x2014;the way he would have pushed Father, an attitude that came easily to him, since not just in face and voice but in evasiveness, smugness, and assumption of authority this expendable was identical to the one that had taken Rigg as an infant from the royal house and raised him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think that with native species,&#x201d; said Vadesh, &#x201c;the parasite rode them lightly. Cooperating with them. Perhaps even helping them survive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But not with humans?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The only part of the earthborn brain it could control was the wild, competitive beast, bent on reproduction at any cost.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That sounds like soldiers on leave,&#x201d; said Loaf.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or academics,&#x201d; said Olivenko.<br> <br>Vadesh said nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;It sounds like chaos,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;You were there from the beginning, weren&#x2019;t you, Vadesh? How long did it take people to learn of the danger?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It took some time for the facemasks to emerge from their chrysalises after the disaster of the human landing,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;And still longer for the people of Vadeshfold to discover that facemasks could infest humans as well as cattle and sheep.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The herders never got infected?&#x201d; asked Loaf.<br> <br>&#x201c;It took time for a strain of facemasks to develop that could thrive on the human body. So at first it was like a pesky fungal infection.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And then it wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;Facemasks are that adaptable?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not blind adaptation,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re a clever, fascinating little creature, not exactly intelligent, but not completely stupid, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>For the first time, it occurred to Rigg that Vadesh was not just fascinated by the facemasks, but enamored of them.<br> <br>&#x201c;They can only attach to their host in the water,&#x201d; said Vadesh, answering a question no one had asked. &#x201c;And once they attach to an air-breather, they lose the ability to breathe in water. They only get their oxygen from the blood. You know what oxygen is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The breathable part of air,&#x201d; said Umbo impatiently. Olivenko chuckled. Of course, thought Rigg&#x2014;Olivenko was a scholar, and Umbo had studied for a time with Rigg&#x2019;s father.<br> <br>But Rigg noticed that Loaf and Param seemed to have no idea what Vadesh meant. How could air be divided in parts? Rigg remembered asking Father exactly that question. But there was no point in explaining the point now or soon or, probably, ever. Why would a soldier-turned-innkeeper and a royal heiress who had fled her throne require a knowledge of the elements, of the behavior of gases and fluids?<br> <br>Then again, Rigg had thought, all through his years of education, tramping with Father through the woods, that he would never need anything Father taught him except how to trap, dress, and skin their prey. Only when Father&#x2019;s death sent Rigg out in the world did he learn why Father had trained him in languages, economics, finance, law, and so many other subjects, all of which had proven vital to his survival.<br> <br>So Rigg started to explain that invisible air was really made of tiny particles of several different types. Loaf looked skeptical and Param bored, and Rigg decided that their education wasn&#x2019;t his job.<br> <br>He fell silent and thought about parasites that could only attach to humans in water, and then they lost the ability to breathe on their own. Rigg filed the information away in his mind, the way Father had taught him to do with all seemingly useless information, so he could recall it whenever Father decided to test him.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve been on my own for a year, thought Rigg, and still in my thoughts he&#x2019;s always there, my pretended father, my kidnapper for all I know. He&#x2019;s the puppeteer who, even dead, is pulling all the strings inside my mind.<br> <br>Lost in such thoughts, Rigg did not notice the first building that came in sight. It was Loaf, ever alert as a soldier should be, who saw the glint of metal. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like the Tower of O,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>It was indeed, in that it was tall and of a similar substance. But it did not rise to a point and was not rounded like a cylinder. And there were several of them nearby, and none of them was half so tall as the Tower of O.<br> <br>But they were impressive nonetheless, and tall enough that it took two more hours of walking after they first saw them for their little group to come close enough to see that these towers were made from the same material, and formed the skyline of a city.<br> <br>&#x201c;How could they build with this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. substance?&#x201d; asked Loaf. &#x201c;People have tried to cut into the Tower of O many times over the years, and neither tool nor fire can affect it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who would try to damage it?&#x201d; asked Umbo.<br> <br>&#x201c;Conquerors who want to show their power,&#x201d; said Olivenko. &#x201c;Rigg&#x2019;s and Param&#x2019;s people arose only lately. The Tower has been there ten thousand years.&#x201d;<br> <br>The talk of duration made Rigg realize something he should have noticed at once, as soon as they knew it was a city they were coming to. There were human paths again, as there had not been near the stream, but all of them were old. None more recent than ten thousand years.<br> <br>&#x201c;How long has this city been abandoned?&#x201d; asked Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t abandoned,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;There hasn&#x2019;t been a human being here for a long time,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve been here,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re not a human being, Rigg wanted to say. You&#x2019;re a machine; you leave no path. A place that contains only you is uninhabited. But it seemed too rude to say aloud. Rigg saw the absurdity of his attitude: If he truly thought of Vadesh as only a machine, rudeness would not be an issue.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did the people go?&#x201d; asked Param.<br> <br>&#x201c;People come and go in the world, and where there once were cities there are only ruins, and where once there was nothing, cities rise,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>Rigg noticed how nonresponsive Vadesh&#x2019;s answer was, but did not challenge him. Rigg trusted Vadesh too little to want him to know he wasn&#x2019;t trusted.<br> <br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s water here?&#x201d; asked Loaf. &#x201c;Because my need for it is getting pretty urgent.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you field soldiers drank your own piss,&#x201d; said Olivenko.<br> <br>&#x201c;We do pee into canteens,&#x201d; said Loaf. &#x201c;But only so we can bring it back for the officers of the city guard to drink.&#x201d;<br> <br>It could have been a quarrel, but to Rigg&#x2019;s relief, Olivenko just smiled and Umbo laughed and it went nowhere. Why did they still irritate each other so much, after all they had been through together? When would rivals become comrades?<br> <br>So all the people of this city were gone. Rigg began to scan for the paths that would show a great migration out of the city, but before he could make much progress, Vadesh led them into a low building of ordinary stone, which showed its many centuries of weathering.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did someone live here?&#x201d; asked Umbo.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a factory,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did all the people sit to work?&#x201d; asked Olivenko.<br> <br>&#x201c;A mechanical factory,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;And most of it is underground. I still use it, when I need any of the things the factory makes. But they needed safe water for the supervisors and mechanics, and for the people who hauled things in and hauled things out.&#x201d; He led them through a doorway into a dark chamber. As they passed through the door after him, a bright light came from above. The whole ceiling was aglow, very much like the lights inside the Tower of O.<br> <br>The others gasped in awe, but Rigg was noticing that the paths of humans into this chamber were few and ancient. This building had only been used for a few decades at the most. It had been abandoned by the same generation of people who had built it.<br> <br>Vadesh touched the front of a thick stone pillar and at once they heard the sound of running water inside the pillar. Then he touched another place, and a portion of the pillar came away in his hand. It was a stone vessel halfway between a drinking mug and a waterbucket in size. He handed it to Loaf. &#x201c;Because your need was so urgent,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it safe?&#x201d; asked Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s filtered through stone. No parasites of any kind can possibly get into this water.&#x201d;<br> <br>Again, Rigg noticed that while Vadesh answered, he only answered about the likelihood of parasite infestation, not the actual question Rigg had asked.<br> <br>Loaf handed the water to Param without tasting it. &#x201c;You need this most,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m a frail princess?&#x201d; Param asked with a hint of resentment.<br> <br>Well, she was physically frail and she was a princess. Until their mother tried to kill her and Rigg, she was assumed to be heir to the Tent of Light. Years of living in the narrow bounds of captivity had made her physically weak, and the journey to the Wall had only improved her stamina by a little. But no one was rude enough to point this out to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You need it most because you and Umbo lived on your water for an extra week that we didn&#x2019;t live through,&#x201d; said Loaf.<br> <br>Param took the water and drank. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It tastes fresh, and nothing else. Except a tinge of something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Trace metals,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;From the rock it filtered through.&#x201d;<br> <br>Umbo drank next. He tried to pass it to Rigg, but Rigg would not take any until Loaf and Olivenko had also drunk.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s plenty,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then finish it, Loaf,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drink from the second serving.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He thinks I spit in it,&#x201d; said Umbo.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; said Loaf. &#x201c;You usually do.&#x201d; Then Loaf drank it off. &#x201c;Delicious,&#x201d; he said, as he handed the empty vessel to Vadesh for refilling.<br> <br>Rigg did not know why he did not trust Vadesh. This expendable had no mannerisms that were not identical to those of Rigg&#x2019;s father. Perhaps that was the cause of his suspicions. But he was sure that Vadesh was deceptive and dangerous, not because he deflected questions and clearly had his own agenda&#x2014;those were Father&#x2019;s constant attributes as well&#x2014;but because of which questions he wouldn&#x2019;t answer.<br> <br>Father would have told me why the people were gone from this...</p><h2>Blackout (John Milton Series)</h2><p>An offer he couldn't refuse.

Farris walks the reader through some of the most important issues in traditional approaches to anthropology, such as sexuality, posthumanism, and the image of God. He addresses fundamental questions like, Who am I? and Why do I exist? He also considers the creaturely and divine nature of humans, the body-soul relationship, and the beatific vision.</p><p><b>Joshua&nbsp;R.

But she's still uneasy at Khattak's tight-lipped secrecy when he asks her to look into Christopher Drayton's death. Drayton's apparently accidental fall from a cliff doesn't seem to warrant a police investigation, particularly not from Rachel and Khattak's team, which handles minority-sensitive cases. But when she learns that Drayton may have been living under an assumed name, Rachel begins to understand why Khattak is tip-toeing around this case. It soon comes to light that Drayton may have been a war criminal with ties to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995.</p><p>If that's true, any number of people might have had reason to help Drayton to his death, and a murder investigation could have far-reaching ripples throughout the community. But as Rachel and Khattak dig deeper into the life and death of Christopher Drayton, every question seems to lead only to more questions, with no easy answers. Had the specters of Srebrenica returned to haunt Drayton at the end, or had he been keeping secrets of an entirely different nature?

He was seated with hislegs folded beneath him on a prayer rug woven by his ancestors from<br>Peshawar. The worn red and gold strands were comforting; his fingers sought them out when he pressed his forehead to the floor. A moment later, his eyes traced them as his cupped palms offered the<br>final supplication. The Maghrib prayer was for Khattak a time of consolation where along with prayers for Muhammad, he asked for mercy upon his wife and forgiveness for the accident that had caused her death. A nightly ritual of grief relieved by the possibility of hope, it stretched across that most resonant band of time: twilight. The dying sun muted his thoughts, much as it subdued the colors of the <i>ja-namaz<br></i>beneath him. It was the discipline of the ritual that brought him comfort, the reason he rarely missed it. Unless he was on duty&#x2014;as he was tonight, when the phone call from Tom Paley disturbed his<br>concentration.</p> <p><br>He no longer possessed the hot-blooded certainties of youth that a prayer missed or delayed would bring about a concomitant judgment of sin. Time had taught him to view his faith through the prism of compassion: when ritual was sacrificed in pursuit of the very values it was meant to inspire, there could be no judgment, no sin. He took the phone call from Tom Paley midway through the prayer and finished up in its aftermath. Tom, the most respected historian at Canada&#x2019;s Department of Justice, would not have disturbed him on an evening when Khattak could just as easily have been off-roster unless the situation was urgent. CPS, the Community Policing Section that Khattak headed, was still fragile, barely a year into its existence. The ambit was deliberately vague because CPS was a fig leaf for the most problematic community relations issue of all&#x2014;Islam. A steady shift to the right in Canadian politics, coupled with the spectacular bungling of the Maher Arar terrorism case in 2002, had birthed a generation of activist lawyers who pushed back vigorously against what they called tainted multiculturalism. Maher Arar&#x2019;s saga of extraordinary rendition and torture had mobilized them, making front-page news for months and costing the federal government millions in compensation when Arar had been cleared of all links to terrorism. A hastily concocted Community Policing Section had been the federal government&#x2019;s response, and who better than Esa Khattak to head it? A second-generation Canadian Muslim, his career had seen him transition seamlessly from Toronto&#x2019;s homicide squad to national counterintelligence work at INSET, one of the Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams. CPS called on both skill sets. Khattak was a rising star with an inbuilt understanding of the city of Toronto&#x2019;s shifting demographic landscape. At CPS, he was asked to lend his expertise to sensitive police investigations throughout the country at the request of se nior investigating offi cers from any branch of government.</p> <p><br>The job had been offered to Khattak as a promotion, his acceptance of it touted as a public relations victory. Khattak had taken it because of the freedom it represented: the chance to appoint his own team, and as with INSET, the opportunity to work with partners at all levels of government to bring nuance and consideration to increasingly complex cases.</p> <p><br>And for other reasons he had never offered up for public scrutiny. His mandate was couched in generic terms: sensitivity training for police services, community support, and an alternative viewpoint in cases involving minorities, particularly Muslim minorities. Both he and his superiors understood the unspoken rationale behind the choice of a decorated INSET officer to head up CPS. If Khattak performed well, then greater glory to the city, province, and nation. If he ran into barriers from within the community as he pursued his coreligionists, no one could accuse the CPS of bias. Everyone&#x2019;s hands were clean.</p> <p><br>It didn&#x2019;t matter to Khattak that this was how he had been lured into the job by his former superintendent, Robert Palmer. He loved police work. It suited an analytical nature tempered by a long-simmering hunger for justice. And if he was being used, as indisputably he was, he was also prepared to enact his own vision for CPS. What flame-fanning bigots across the border would doubtlessly call community pandering, a fig-leaf jihad. Take anything a Muslim touched, add the word jihad to it, and immediately you produced something ugly and divisive. But Tom wasn&#x2019;t one of these. Chief historian at the Department of Justice, he was a gifted academic whose fatherly demeanor masked a passion for the truth as sharp and relentless as Khattak&#x2019;s own.</p> <p><br>He had called to ask Khattak to investigate the death of a Scarborough man named Christopher Drayton. There was no reason that CPS should have an interest in the man&#x2019;s death. He had fallen from a section of the Scarborough Bluffs known as the Cathedral. His death had been swift and certain with no evidence of outside interference. Khattak had pointed this out to his friend in measured tones, and<br>Tom had let him. When he&#x2019;d finished, Tom gave him the real reason for his call and the reason it encroached upon Khattak&#x2019;s jurisdiction. Khattak heard the worry and fear beneath Tom Paley&#x2019;s words.</p> <p>And into the remnants of Khattak&#x2019;s prayer intruded a series of recollections from his youth. Of news reports, hurriedly organized meetings and volunteer drives, followed too slowly by action. He saw<br>himself as a young man joining others in a circle around the flame at Parliament Hill. He absorbed the thick, despairing heat of that summer into his skin. His dark hair flattened against his head; he felt in that moment his own impotence. He listened to Tom&#x2019;s labored explanation, not liking the hitch in his friend&#x2019;s breath. When Tom came to the nature of his request, Khattak agreed. But his words were slow, weighted by the years that had passed since that summer. Still, he would do as asked.<br></p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go alone,&#x201d; Tom said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to look objective.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>Khattak took no offense at the phrasing. He knew the unspoken truth as well as Tom did.</p> <p><br><i>Because you can&#x2019;t be.</i></p> <p><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take Rachel.&#x201d; He had told Tom about his partner, Rachel Getty, before.</p> <p><br>&#x201c;You know her well enough to trust her?&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the best officer I&#x2019;ve ever worked with.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s young.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;Not so young that she doesn&#x2019;t understand our work. And I find her perspective helps me.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>He meant it. But even as he said it he knew that he would work with Rachel as he had done in the past. Withholding a part of the truth, of himself, until he could see the world through the clear, discerning eyes that watched him with such trust.</p> <p><br>He knew he could turn to his childhood friend, Nathan Clare, for background on Drayton. Nate lived on the Bluff s and would understand why he&#x2019;d agreed to Tom&#x2019;s request. Nate would understand as<br>well the toll compliance would take. But Khattak&#x2019;s bond with Nate had long since been severed. It was a mistake to think Nate still knew him at all.<br></p> <p>He&#x2019;d meant the last words of his prayer to be a blessing asked for his family, in a space he tried to keep for himself, exchanging solitude for solace. Lately, he&#x2019;d come to accept that there was no separate<br>peace. His work, and the harshness of the choices he had made, bled into everything.</p> <p><br>He rose from his prayer rug to find that dusk had given way to dark. He thought of the tiny documents library in Ottawa with its overflowing shelves. He&#x2019;d spent most of that long-ago summer there, collecting evidence.</p> <p><br>And he remembered other words, other blessings to be sought with a premonition of ruin.</p> <p><i>They are going to burn us all.</i></p></p><h2>The Minions of Time (The Wormling)</h2><p>&#x201c;Nothing special&#x201d; is the best way to describe Owen Reeder&#x2015;at least that's what he's been told all his life.

Now, award-winning historian Joseph M. Marshall presents the revisionist view of the Battle of the Little Bighorn that has been available only in the Lakota oral tradition. Drawing on this rich source of storytelling, Marshall uncovers what really took place at the Little Big Horn and provides fresh insight into the significance of that bloody day.</p><p>Joseph M. Marshall III, historian and storyteller, is the author of six previous books, including <b>The Lakota Way: Stories and Lessons for Living</b>, which was a finalist for the PEN Center USA West Award in 2002.&nbsp; He was raised on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation and his first language is Lakota. Marshall is a recipient of the Wyoming Humanities Award. He makes his home on the Northern Plains.America's westward expansion in the 19th century was far from a foregone conclusion to the thousands of indigenous peoples, whose ancient way of life lay in its path. Historian Marshall (<i>The Journey of Crazy Horse</i>; <i>The Lakota Way</i>), who was born on South Dakota's Rosebud Sioux Reservation and has long chronicled the traditions and perspective of the Great Plains tribes, explains the context and the painful aftermath of this major turning point in his people's history. His careful description of the Greasy Grass Fight of 1876 (or the Battle of the Little Bighorn) overturns the popular misconception that the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors' victory over the U.S. Seventh Cavalry was a "fluke" or, worse still, "a massacre." Yet he also registers the enormity of the change that followed&#x2014;including forced settlement, assimilation and dependency&#x2014;when Crazy Horse surrendered his rifle to a U.S. Army officer less than a year later. Chapters alternately emphasizing strategy, weaponry, beliefs, lifestyle and other areas lend a fractured quality and some redundancy to the narrative. But Marshall's thoughtful reflections and rich detail (much of it drawn from the oral stories of unidentified Lakota elders) also immerse the reader in the experience of a once free people wrestling with an uncertain destiny. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With the help of Papa Bird, maybe Little Bird will learn another new word--one that will make things all better.</p></p><p><b>Jacob Grant</b> is originally from Ohio, but now lives with his wife in a very windy city in Illinois. Day and night he can be found in his home studio drawing, painting, and writing until something feels story-ish. His debut picture book, <i>Scaredy Kate</i>, was released in 2014. Jacob tries not to use bad words around any little animals.PreS-K&#x2014;After accidentally dropping his wiggling lunch (a worm), Papa Bird expresses his frustration with the expletive "Blark!" Little Bird, who is always eager to learn new words, begins to shout his new word at all of his friends but is surprised to learn that they do not like it. "Could this new word be...bad?" In simple text and complementary illustrations, this is a gentle, albeit somewhat oversimplified lesson in how using language can sometimes be hurtful to others. In the end, Papa Bird also teaches Little Bird another word by example: "Sorry!" The author sneaks in a small humorous twist on the final page that will more than likely amuse adults. The digitally colored charcoal artwork on white or solid-hued backgrounds is fresh and energetic. The cartoon style and bright colors keep the tone light and engaging, and creative typography is used to good effect.

The great Romantic poem of human consciousness, it takes as its theme &#39;the growth of a poet&#39;s mind&#39;: leading the reader back to Wordsworth&#39;s formative moments of childhood and youth, and detailing his experiences as a radical undergraduate in France at the time of the Revolution. Initially inspired by Coleridge&#39;s exhortation that Wordsworth write a work upon the French Revolution, The Prelude has ultimately become one of the finest examples of poetic autobiography ever written; a fascinating examination of the self that also presents a comprehensive view of the poet&#39;s own creative vision.</p><p>The great Romantic poem of human consciousness, The Prelude takes as its theme &#39;the growth of a poet&#39;s mind&#39;. In its search for the origins of the adult personality, The Prelude takes the reader back to the formative moments of childhood and youth: the baby at the breast, the boy ranging over the Cumbrian fells, the revolutionary undergraduate. In many ways it can be seen as the first modern poem, challenging Milton in its redefinition of epic, as Milton challenged Homer and Virgil. This new Penguin English Poets edition of The Prelude contains the brief first draft, Was It for This, composed in 1798; The Prelude in two books completed in 1799; and The Prelude in its 1805 and 1850 versions, printed here in parallel texts. The editor provides an invaluable introduction to the texts and fuller, more detailed notes than in any previous edition, as well as significant textual variants and a biographical table of dates.William Wordsworth was born in the Lake District in 1770 and died there eighty years later in 1850. He had three brothers and a sister, Dorothy, to whom he was extremely close. As an undergraduate at Cambridge, Wordsworth travelled widely and wrote poetry. He spent his twenties as a wanderer in France, Wales, London, the Lakes, Dorset and Germany. In France he fathered a child who he did not meet until she was nine, due to the war. In 1795 he was reunited with Dorothy and met Coleridge, who was to be a particular influence on his poetry. He became Poet Laureate in 1843. Jonathan Wordsworth is descended from William&#39;s younger brother Christopher, is Chairman of the Wordsworth Trust and a Lecturer in Romantic Studies at Oxford.</p><h2>Men in Love</h2><p>An extraordinary, explicitly masculine journey,&nbsp;<i>Men In Love</i>&nbsp;develops a startlingly honest portrayal of what it means to be a man in contemporary America. Here are the unexpurgated dreams, fantasies and fetishes that excite and obsess men today. In creating this historic study, Nancy Friday listened--without disapproval, apology or censorship--to the candid responses of thousands of men aged fourteen through sixty. She gave them a legitimate arena where they could share their "secret gardens"--the hidden and forbidden but nonetheless real and true. Much more than a litany of erotica, this unique volume doesn't tell us how men should love. It tells us how men do love--a stunning insight into the desires that dwell within men's psyches... and their hearts.</p><p><b>Nancy Friday</b> established herself as a magazine journalist in New York, England, Italy, and France before turning to writing full time and publishing her first book,&nbsp;<i>My Secret Garden</i>, in 1973, which became a bestseller. Friday has regularly returned to the interview format in her subsequent books on themes ranging from mothers and daughters to sexual fantasies, relationships, jealousy, envy, feminism, and beauty.Chapter 1 <br> &nbsp;<br> THE MASCULINE<br> CONFLICT<br> &nbsp;<br> This is a book about men who love women.<br> &nbsp;<br> Women may not easily recognize that emotion in these pages. These are not conventional valentines. His secret garden is not like mine.<br> &nbsp;<br> A contemporary confusion is that if the sexes are equal, it must mean they are identical; men often predicted I&#x2019;d find their fantasies similar to women&#x2019;s. We may seek the same goal in fantasy&#x2014;sexual excitement&#x2014;but men and women get there by different paths.<br> &nbsp;<br> A fantasy is a map of desire, mastery, escape, and obscuration; the navigational path we invent to steer ourselves between the reefs and shoals of anxiety, guilt, and inhibition. It is a work of consciousness, but in reaction to unconscious pressures. What is fascinating is not only how bizarre fantasies are, but how comprehensible; each one gives us a coherent and consistent picture of the personality&#x2014;the unconscious&#x2014;of the person who invented it, even though he may think it the random whim of the moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> A man has a reverie of meeting a blond woman in a purple nightgown. He doesn&#x2019;t know why the colors are exciting; his unconscious does, but doesn&#x2019;t bother to explain. The man only knows the blonder, the purple-ier, the more heated he grows. Soon he is inventing scenarios of bare-breasted models hired to test new peroxide hair bleaches, supplied by a company that arbitrarily orders all contestants to wear purple underwear. If the plot seems silly, what does it matter? The erotic has its reasons that reason doesn&#x2019;t know.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like an Einsteinian equation whose logic would take hours to unravel, a fantasy appears in the mind with the speed of light, connecting hitherto seemingly unrelated and mysterious forces in the internal erotic universe, resolving inconsistencies and contradictions that seemed insuperable before. Nothing is included by accident. If the woman is tall or short, if she forgets her birth control pills and so intercourse carries the risk of pregnancy&#x2014;if there is a cuckoo clock on the wall&#x2014;it is all meaningful to the inventor&#x2019;s heightened sexuality.<br> &nbsp;<br> In real life, ambivalence abounds. Women want men, men want women; our dreams of one another, fantasies, not only express our most direct desires but also portray the obstacles that must be symbolically overcome to win sexual pleasure. Fantasy is as close as we will ever come again to the omnipotent joys we once knew as infants. In a moment of rage we say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to kill you!&#x201d; This is a fleeting fantasy, a satisfying violent image which expresses the overheated mood of the moment. But how likely are we to pull a gun and do it? It is important to recognize that not all fantasies are frustrated wishes. This is one of the most common misconceptions about fantasy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The very courage of fantasies in facing up to, and giving relief to, unconscious horrors, can sometimes make them hard to take. In 1975, I met a man who had written a book on men&#x2019;s sexual daydreams. &#x201c;The material was so awful and creepy,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t even talk to my contributors on the phone. I made them speak into an automatic answering machine, and then had the stuff typed up. I couldn&#x2019;t even bring myself to correct the galleys.&#x201d; I had not read his book and was not surprised never to hear of it again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beneath their locker room camaraderie and famous mutual support systems, it appeared, men were as sexually restrictive and normative with one another as women have traditionally been with their sisters. Wouldn&#x2019;t a woman who does not see men as competitors or sexual rivals have fewer hurdles in accepting male sexuality, no matter what turns it might take? All my life I&#x2019;d dreamed of men and sought their company. Even more than the eight years I&#x2019;d spent researching two books on women&#x2019;s fantasies (My Secret Garden and Forbidden Flowers), I believed this simple, uninstructed love of men was my best credential for undertaking this work.<br> &nbsp;<br> I found I had awarded myself the palm too easily.<br> &nbsp;<br> While the sexual fantasies of many men were a pleasure and easily available to my emotions right from the start, others disgusted or frightened me. Many seemed outpourings from macho braggarts out to shock or trap me in filth. I was like the Victorian husband who encourages his wife to tell all. When she does, he leaves her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh, I&#x2019;d had a few difficult moments in my earlier books with women who were aroused&#x2014;for instance&#x2014;by a loss of bladder control; but on the whole I was able to accept any feminine notion, if only on grounds that it came from a woman. When a woman called a cock a cock, talked of being rammed or reamed, described her cunt juices or the sensation of sucking on a dog&#x2019;s erection, any trepidation I might feel was outweighed by admiration: Our side was breaking through the centuries of female silence at last.<br> &nbsp;<br> But when men used words like cunt lapping or pussy, they aroused early, primitive fears. Louder than the unabashed sensual love the words were meant to express, I heard the harshness and disdain of the street slang. Long before sex and men had entered my life, a woman had taught me to be a lady. &#x201c;Excuse my vocabulary,&#x201d; more than one man wrote me. At first I would smile at these apologies. I have come to see that my contributors knew me better than I did.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ladies. Gentlemen. Cunts. Cocks. To put the four words together is to show how little they seem to have to do with each other. How could I respect a man who wanted to be pissed or shit on? While I felt it was life-enhancing for a woman to dream of sex with two men, I felt compassion for the unfortunate woman married to a man so low he ejaculated to fantasies of showing off her cunt to a stranger.<br> &nbsp;<br> Something in me could not accept men unless they conformed to dreams of my own. The Fantasy Queen had opened a Pandora&#x2019;s box she could not handle.<br> &nbsp;<br> I do not necessarily expect sex to be pretty; that is to demean it, attenuate its primitive force. But many of these fantasies were more than I wanted to hear. Why, they were filth! Letter after letter left me with a feeling that I wanted to wash my hands. I often did.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even as I reached for the soap, I had to laugh at myself. Where was my vaunted objectivity? I watched my disgust with fascination. When my editors suggested I clean up my copy, substitute &#x201c;excrement&#x201d; for shit, &#x201c;sex&#x201d; for fucking, I objected; if I latinized my writing, drew a sharp line between my text and the four-letter language of fantasy itself, I would be joining the very army of inhibitors I was protesting against. And yet, demanding this freedom for myself, cheering it enthusiastically when it was exercised by women, here I was, objecting to it in men.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today, while I still find some of this material difficult, I no longer see it as a personal affront. It might be said that familiarity freed me; the third time around, the shock is abated. But that is too simple. It would be more accurate to say I could not come to terms with this book until I had won free of the narcissistic desire to see men in a way that enlarged my own view of myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> All my life I&#x2019;ve been haunted by a little girl&#x2019;s voice within that said women needed men&#x2014;I needed men&#x2014;more than they needed us. Men could always go off to Singapore or drink alone in bars, but women ceased to exist in their own eyes when men were gone. I watch the ease with which some women today decide to build a life without men (who never lived up to their expectations anyway) in favor of pursuing newly won autonomy. I can understand the sense of freedom born of ridding oneself of the childish&#x2014;and ultimately false&#x2014;security that comes from binding oneself to a man; but I do not believe men could ever abandon women so swiftly. In fact, this book has persuaded me that men want women more than the other way around. Toward satisfying their love, need, desire, lust, men will give up more than women will.<br> &nbsp;<br> Women call themselves the loving sex; we are always waiting for men, always dreaming of them. We need them to put to rest the gnawing anxiety that comes from never being taught a sense of independent worth or self. Is this love or is it dependency? When men do offer love, why is it so often felt to be lacking: &#x201c;Hold me tighter, never let me go,&#x201d; women beg, unable to find in any man&#x2019;s arms the kind of iron security that dependent, passive people need. The point I want to make is this: Is it the man she really wants, or is it the relief from anxiety which he symbolized?<br> &nbsp;<br> When women can get their emotional needs satisfied elsewhere, don&#x2019;t they often forget about men? Take the familiar picture of a woman who has found such close-close togetherness with her children that father feels left out. How many men do you know who neglect their wives for their children?<br> &nbsp;<br> Men are trained to find their security in themselves. Women are their emotional outlet, their main source of love. If, as women believe, men are so lucky, so self-sufficient, so free, dominant, and irresponsible, living in an option-filled man&#x2019;s world, why do they give it all up for marriage? Men may resist, but in the end most do marry because they want women more than anything else; if responsibilities, mortgages, ulcers, child care, and monogamy are part of the package they must buy to get women, they&#x2019;ll do it. The thesis of this book is that men&#x2019;s love of women is filled with rage. Observation shows that in the end love wins out over rage.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the end, I came to see that even people who wrote in an attempt at aggressive sexual contact with me were also moved by a kind of love and desire for connection with, not really me, but a fantasy of woman in general. Distorted love, ambivalent love, love mixed with rage; love nevertheless.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>30 Days of Prayer For Spiritual Stamina (Elijah)</h2><p>Life is like a roller coaster, and we need spiritual stamina or &#x201c;staying power&#x201d; in order to stay true to our faith and calling through all the ups and downs.

Strategically located in the heart of Central Asia, sandwiched between Vladimir Putin's Russia, its former colonial ruler, and Xi Jinping's China, this vast oil-rich state is carving out its place in the world as it contends with its own complex past and present.

A colourful cast of characters brings the politics to life: from strutting oligarch to sleeping villagers, from principled politicians to striking oilmen, from crusading journalists to courageous campaigners.<br>Traversing dust-blown deserts and majestic mountains, taking in glitzy cities and dystopian landscapes, <i>Dark Shadows </i>conjures up Kazakhstan as a living, breathing place, full of extraordinary people living extraordinary lives.</p></p><p><b>Joanna Lillis</b> is a Kazakhstan-based journalist reporting on Central Asia whose work has featured in the Guardian, The Economist and the Independent newspapers, the Eurasianet website and Foreign Policy and POLITICO magazines.

Since the 1960s, unmanned military and commercial spacecraft have been orbiting near the Earth, and robotic deep-space explorers have sent back stunning images of faraway planets. Neufeld begins with the origins of space ideas and the discovery that rocketry could be used for spaceflight. He then discusses the Soviet-U.S. Cold War space race and reminds us that NASA resisted adding female astronauts even after the Soviets sent the first female cosmonaut into orbit. He analyzes the two rationales for the Apollo program: prestige and scientific discovery (this last something of an afterthought). He describes the internationalization and privatization of human spaceflight after the Cold War, the cultural influence of space science fiction, including Star Trek and Star Wars, space tourism for the ultra-rich, and the popular desire to go into space. Whether we become a multiplanet species, as some predict, or continue to call Earth home, this book offers a useful primer.</p></p><p>Michael J.

It spread a previously unimaginable level of broad prosperity. It enabled steep increases in education, health, longevity, and economic security. And yet, extraordinarily, it is anathema to many current economic and political elites. Looking at this record of remarkable accomplishment, they recoil in horror. And as the advocates of anti-government free market fundamentalist have gained power, they are hell-bent on scrapping the instrument of nearly a century of unprecedented economic and social progress.

Yet as we have faltered in harnessing the enormous positive potential of public authority, we have also fallen behind the pace of social improvement in other rich nations, as well as the pace we set in our own past. In area after area where we once dominated, we are falling down the rankings of social success. In area after area where new threats loom, we are failing to rise up to the challenge. We are not standing tall&#x2014;literally, we shall see&#x2014;and our malign neglect of the mixed economy bears a great deal of the blame.<br> Losing Ground<p></p> <br>For much of US history, Americans were the tallest people in the world by a large margin. When the thirteen colonies that occupied the Atlantic seaboard broke from the British Empire, adult American men were on average three inches taller than their counterparts in England, and they were almost that much taller than men in the Netherlands, the great economic power before Britain.1 Revolutionary soldiers looked up to General George Washington, but not, as often assumed, because he was a giant among Lilliputians. David McCullough, in his popular biography of John Adams, describes Washington as &#x201c;nearly a head taller than Adams&#x2014;six feet four in his boots, taller than almost anyone of the day.&#x201d;2 Those must have been some boots, for Washington was six feet two.3 At five foot seven, Adams was just an inch below the average for American soldiers and significantly taller than a typical European soldier.4<br> <br>Americans were tall because Americans were healthy. &#x201c;Poor as they were,&#x201d; notes the colonial historian William Polk, &#x201c;Americans ate and were housed better than Englishmen.&#x201d;5 Sickness and premature death were common, of course, especially outside the privileged circle of white men. Still, European visitors like Tocqueville marveled at the fertility of the land and the robustness of its settlers, the relative equality of male citizens and the strong civic bonds among them.6 J. Hector St. John de Cr�vecoeur wrote in 1782 of the American settler in Letters from an American Farmer, &#x201c;Instead of starving he will be fed, instead of being idle he will have employment, and there are riches enough for such men as come over here.&#x201d;7<br> <br>The cause of the American height advantage could not have been income alone. According to most sources, the average resident of the Netherlands or England was richer than colonial Americans but also substantially shorter.8 Indeed, as the United States matched and then surpassed Europe economically in the nineteenth century, the average height of American men actually fell, recovering back to colonial levels only around the dawn of the twentieth century.9 These ebbs and flows, which played out in other industrializing nations as well, are a reminder that economic growth and population health are not one and the same.10 (We shall unravel the mystery of their interdependence in the next chapter.) Nonetheless, Americans remained far and away the tallest people in the world throughout the nineteenth century, and average American heights rose quickly in the early decades of the twentieth.11 When the United States entered World War II, young American men averaged five feet nine inches&#x2014;almost two inches taller, on average, than the young Germans they were fighting.12<br> <br>While people know that height is a strong predictor of individual achievement (test scores, occupational prestige, pay), it is also a revealing marker of population health.13 Height has a lot to do with genes, but height differences across nations seem to be caused mostly by social conditions, such as income, nutrition, health coverage, and social cohesion.14 Indeed, one reason for the correlation between height and achievement is that kids whose mothers are healthy during pregnancy and who grow up with sufficient food, medical care, and family support tend to be taller adults. An average US white girl born in the early 1910s could expect to reach around five foot three; an average US white girl born in the late 1950s could expect to exceed five foot five.15 Evolution just doesn&#x2019;t happen that fast.<br> <br>So it&#x2019;s striking that Americans are no longer the tallest people in the world. Not even close: Once three inches taller than residents of the Old World, on average, Americans are now about three inches shorter. The average Dutch height for men is six foot one, and for women, five foot eight&#x2014;versus five foot nine for American men and five foot five for American women.16 The gap is not, as might be supposed, a result of immigration: White, native-born Americans who speak English at home are significantly smaller, too, and immigration isn&#x2019;t substantial enough to explain the discrepancy in any case.17 Nor can the growing gap be explained by differences in how height is measured. Though some countries rely on self-reported heights for their statistics&#x2014;and, yes, men tend to &#x201c;round up&#x201d;&#x2014;Americans look shorter even when the only countries in the rankings are those that, like the United States, measure heights directly.18<br> <br>Americans are not shrinking. (Overall, that is&#x2014;there is some evidence that both white and black women born after 1960 are shorter than their parents.)19 But the increase in Americans&#x2019; average stature has been glacial, even as heights continue to rise steadily abroad. To really see our lost height advantage, you have to break the population into age groups, or what demographers call birth cohorts. People in their twenties, after all, are as tall as they will ever be. Changes in average height come from changes in the height of the young (and deaths among older cohorts). And, indeed, the adult heights of those born during a given period provide a powerful image of the living conditions experienced by infants and adolescents at the time. The fall in average heights among those born in the mid-1800s, for example, signaled the costs as well as benefits of the country&#x2019;s industrial and urban shift, which brought increased infectious disease as well as higher incomes, harsher lives for the masses as well as better lives for the elite.20 (The privileged American men who applied for passports in 1890 were, on average, more than an inch and a half taller than army recruits at the time.)21<br> <br>In general, heights are converging among affluent nations, and the biggest gains have occurred in countries admitted most recently to the rich-nation club.22 Within countries, younger age groups are generally much taller than older age groups&#x2014;which makes sense: Older people spent their growing years (including their growth within the womb) in poorer societies with more limited health technology and knowledge.23 But the United States is a conspicuous exception to these patterns: Average heights have barely budged in recent decades, so young Americans&#x2014;again, even when leaving out recent immigrants&#x2014;are barely taller than their parents.24 Older Americans are roughly on par with their counterparts abroad; younger Americans are substantially shorter. The United States is the richest populous nation in the world. Nevertheless, its young are roughly as tall as the young in Portugal, which has a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) less than half ours.25<br> On Rankings and Ratings<p></p> <br>Because height is a powerful indicator of social and individual health, America&#x2019;s relative decline should ring alarms. Our young are coming up short&#x2014;relative not just to gains in stature of the past but also to gains in stature in other rich nations.<br> <br>Still, if shorter kids were the only sign of trouble, we might safely ignore the alarms. For all but aspiring basketball players, tallness is not an end in itself. It can even create problems: The Dutch have had to rewrite their building codes so men don&#x2019;t routinely smash their heads into door frames.26 Unfortunately, America&#x2019;s journey from tallest to smallish has played out in area after area. When it comes to health, education, and even income&#x2014;still our strongest suit, though we&#x2019;re holding fewer high cards than in the past&#x2014;we are falling down the rankings of social success.<br> <br>We often miss this, and not just because triumphant cries of American exceptionalism drown out the alarms. Comparing countries on indicators of social health is tricky, and the temptation to stack the deck is strong. Moreover, our standard statistics frequently understate how poorly the United States is doing at harnessing the combined energies of government and the market. To get an accurate picture, we have to spend a little time sifting through the best available data, separating the meaningful from the misleading. We also have to focus on the experiences most relevant for understanding not how we&#x2019;ve done in the past but how we are doing now&#x2014;and unless we change course, how we are likely to do in the future.<br> <br>Put another way, not all performance assessments are equally valid or instructive. Each year brings scores of scores purporting to rank almost every conceivable object of interest&#x2014;schools, businesses, cities, states, regions, countries&#x2014;across almost every conceivable category, from college completion, to wine consumption, to online porn viewing. (For the record, Washington, DC, tops US state rankings in all three.) But sensibly comparing states, countries, or anything else requires following a few simple ground rules. The first is to compare apples to apples. Washington, DC, isn&#x2019;t actually that comparable to the fifty states because it&#x2019;s essentially a big city (hence the porn-wine-college trifecta). For cross-national analysis, comparing apples to apples means comparing countries at similar levels of economic development. It also means using indicators that are as close to the same as possible across nations. And it requires transparency: Proprietary data and secret formulas are anathema to serious comparison (but endemic to many special-interest rankings).<br> <br>So we should compare apples to apples. But which apples should we be comparing? A good place to begin is the three core components of the UN&#x2019;s Human Development Index: health, education, and income. The index captures the idea that development is about &#x201c;advancing the richness of human life&#x201d;&#x2014;to quote its intellectual father, the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen&#x2014;and not just &#x201c;the richness of the economy in which human beings live.&#x201d;27 The index itself isn&#x2019;t all that useful for ranking rich nations. It often sets the bar low (can people read and write?), and it&#x2019;s limited to a few basic indicators available for all countries. Nonetheless, the UN&#x2019;s pioneering investigations provide a solid jumping-off point for asking how well the contemporary United States is doing relative to other rich nations in fostering citizens&#x2019; well-being.<br> <br>When asking that question, the issue isn&#x2019;t merely how well we are doing today. It&#x2019;s also whether we are pulling ahead or falling behind. One data point gives us a level; two or more give us a trend. And, in general, it&#x2019;s trends that reveal the most about our relative performance. To be sure, we should be careful not to read too much into short-term fluctuations. Nor should we forget that on many metrics, there is a natural process of &#x201c;reversion to the mean&#x201d;: Relative to other countries, the highest-performing nations are more likely to fall toward other nations&#x2019; performances, and the lowest performing to rise toward other nations&#x2019; performances.<br> <br>Still, trends matter most. And that means we should be at least as interested in the direction social indicators are heading (and at what pace) as in their level. It also means we should pay special attention to one particular group: the young. Most cross-national analyses look at countries as a whole, comparing several generations of people in one nation with several generations in another. Sometimes that&#x2019;s appropriate. If we want to know which countries are good at getting all citizens flu shots, we are interested in national averages. Usually, however, the experience of the young is most revealing, and not just because the young are most affected by current conditions. The young tell us about trends. If, for example, we&#x2019;re falling behind in getting young adults through college (and we are), looking at the average educational level of the entire population will provide false reassurance. Typically, then, the critical comparisons across nations concern the young. Unhappily, these are also the comparisons where the most troubling image of American performance emerges.<br> <br>A final issue to keep in mind: Investment (or lack of investment) does not bear its (bitter) fruit immediately. Supporting science, technology, and education, for example, reaps big returns.28 But it takes time&#x2014;sometimes a long time&#x2014;to see the payoffs. As we will see in chapters 2 and 4, the high-tech expansion of the last few decades rested on scientific and technical advances seeded more than a generation earlier.29 The opposite problem arises in cases of deferred maintenance: failing to upgrade critical infrastructure, for example, or to seed technological advances that will blossom in the future. The costs, though real, won&#x2019;t be fully apparent for some time.<br> <br>The same can be said about failing to tackle emerging challenges&#x2014;an area where, we shall see, the United States is doing especially poorly. A generation ago, few worried about how well nations were addressing obesity or global warming. Now we know that the health of our society and the future of our planet depend on effective responses. The low bar for social performance is continuing to meet challenges we&#x2019;ve met before. The high bar is doing well where we face new challenges. Unfortunately, not only is the United States having trouble clearing the low bar; it is barely even trying to clear the higher one.<br> <br>The United States is still a remarkably successful nation. Over the last century, we have achieved unprecedented levels of prosperity, witnessed quantum increases in health and life expectancy, and sought to address problems that once mocked our finest traditions of democracy and opportunity, from vicious racial exclusion to grim elderly poverty to dangerously unclean air and water. And we have continued to gain ground in many of these areas over the last generation. Yet these gains have been halting and slow. Even more worrisome, they lag behind gains in other rich democracies.<br> Health<p></p> <br>Among the big three of health, education, and income, none is more important than health. Those who study the economics of health and longevity find consistently that the value of physical well-being within a society vastly exceeds a nation&#x2019;s total income.30 But even without such calculations, we all know that health is a precondition for everything else we seek to achieve. When the Declaration of Independence celebrated &#x201c;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,&#x201d; there was a reason &#x201c;life&#x201d; l...</p><h2>Remembering Shanghai: A Memoir of Socialites, Scholars and Scoundrels</h2><p><br><b>WINNER - 2019 Rubery Book Award BOOK OF THE YEAR and 16 other literary awards...&nbsp;An Engaging and Extraordinary Multigenerational Saga</b><br><br>A high position bestowed by China's empress dowager grants power and wealth to the Sun family.

How he overcame his fears is a dramatic, heart-warming story. It is most refreshing to read how the Boston Red Sox, from manager down, backed up Jim in his fight for rehabilitation, and helped him regain the confidence that brought him back.&#34;-Library Journal (Library Journal )</p><p>Once again, the Bison Books imprint of the University of Nebraska Press has reached into baseball's past and returned with a Hall of Fame read. <i>Fear Strikes Out</i> is one of the game's most dramatic autobiographies. It is also one of the most important. When first published in 1955, it ventured into territory traditionally considered out of play for a sports story. "I must have been quite a card when I first broke into baseball's big league as a Boston Red Sox rookie in 1952," Piersall opens rather cheerily. He was a baseball clown, and the fans loved his offbeat shenanigans. One paragraph later, he tosses a huge, hanging curve. "Almost everybody...thought I was a riot. My wife knew I was sick, yet she was helpless to stop my mad rush toward a mental collapse."<p> In time, Piersall would become one of the silkiest centerfielders of the '50s--no mean feat given his contemporaries Mantle and Mays. A new afterword by Piersall catches us up to his later years (and stunts) in baseball and his post-career as a broadcaster. <i>Fear</i> is actually a prologue to that. It's a courageous story. Piersall's demons had him by the throat and nearly choked him. The breakdown he suffered early in his rookie years was so complete and so terrifying that his mind blanked out the next seven months before his own healing allowed for a painful reconstruction. Given that <i>Fear</i> was written in an era before biographic confessional and the public washing of an athlete's unclean flannels, Piersall's honesty and detail about mental illness, hospitalization, psychiatric therapy, and the struggle back to sanity are extraordinary. This is a truly marvelous book--better than the movie starring Anthony Perkins that was made from it--and, like the lead-off hitter Piersall was, it's earned its spot at the top of the order of any serious collection of baseball biographies. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Jim Piersall played baseball in the 1950s and 1960s for the Boston Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians, the Washington Senators, the New York Mets, and the California Angels.

Their quest takes them to major world cities, where they learn of their family heritage as Egyptian magicians who seek to destroy evil forces throughout civilization. The book has a cinematic feel, with excellent aerial shots, images revealed from unique points of view, and action delineated by slanted panels. The full-color art has a slick, luminous quality, enhancing the magical elements. Color is used to excellent advantage. For example, historical images in monochromatic shades of silver, copper, and blue visually distinguish the old kingdoms. Judicious use of red text reinforces the evil voice of Sekhmet. The powerful superhero quality is evident throughout the tale, where gods and goddesses resemble superheroes. Women move like superheroes, especially Bast, who claims "Combat magic is my specialty." Contests between warring powers, the scorpion sequence, the appearance of Sekhmet, and the boat traversing the cataract all crackle with action. Occasionally, some of the changes in layout, such as a full-page horizontal spread of selected panels, abruptly interrupt the narrative flow and make following the story confusing. Still, readers will eagerly identify with Carter when he declares, "It was a fight to the death and I felt great." This action adventure is jam-packed with ancient Egyptian culture and mythology, and will captivate young readers.-Barbara M.

This classic guide, with floor plans ranging from a small casita to larger ones gives 18 comprehensive period designs for the traditional adobe (the earthern ''bricks'' used all over the world) house adapted to building materials, plumbing, heating and small lot sizes of today. Thousands of readers have found this a valuable handbook. The authors also venture into actual adobe brick-making, construction techniques, furnishing, even how to make a horno, a traditional Indian oven. Illustrated, detailed diagrams, house plans.<p> The first seeds for the concept for this book on adobe architecture were sown as early as 1916, when Wilfred Stedman was a student at the Art Students League in New York City. It was there that he saw Ernest Blumenschein and Bert Phillips' paintings of adobe homes in villages in and around Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico. When in the early 1920s and 1930s Wilfred and Myrtle came to see and experience this area for themselves, they met Mary Austin, Alice Corbin Henderson, Will Shuster, Frank Applegate, Josef Bakos and Mabel Dodge Luhan--all famous artists and writers of that time. These people made themselves and their friends from all over the world feel at home in this vernacular architecture.</p><p> While nowhere in the United States is the Earth Building spirit as revered as in Santa Fe and Taos, new interest is spreading all over the world. New research and new technology is being combined with the traditional in keeping with an overall awakening to the natural resources and beauty of our planet and with a new personal sense of responsibility on the part of individuals in regard to better planning in the use of these. There is a new sense of joy in finding out how much one can do oneself with natural materials.</p></p><p>A guide, with floor plans ranging from a small casita to larger ones is given in this book, with several pluses. The smaller homes are so arranged that they allow for growth as the family, or purse, increases in size. Cabinet work throughout is in keeping and suggestions for furniture designed to complement the house are here. Plastering, the making of adobes, painting, plumbing, wiring--all the things that must be taken into account are dealt with in a practical manner that helps prevent costly errors.Myrtle Stedman was known as an ''Artist in Adobe,'' designing, building, and remodeling adobe homes under a contractor's license. She was also a well-known artist whose academic training started in 1927 when she was a student in the Houston Museum of Fine Arts school. Her English born husband, Wilfred Stedman, whose background was in architecture as well as in painting and illustrating was recognized as one of the most outstanding artists of the American Southwest. Adobe architecture in New Mexico was one of Wilfred's favorite topics of conversation and Myrtle was instilled with the love of adobes from the moment they were married. After his death in 1950, Myrtle went on to become one of the foremost authorities on adobe construction. Myrtle Stedman was a member of PEN New Mexico, a branch of PEN Center USA West of International PEN and believed that there is no end to what the mind can do with the eye and hand, in time and in spirit. She is also the author of <i>Artists in Adobe, A House Not Made With Hands, Adobe Remodeling and Fireplaces, Of One Mind, Of Things to Come, Ongoing Life, Rural Architecture, The Ups and Downs of Living Alone in Later Life,</i> and The Way Things Are or Could Be, all from Sunstone Press.</p><h2>Dionysos Exciter to Frenzy: A study of the God Dionysos: history, myth and lore</h2><p><p><em>"There was 'no god more present' than Dionysos: that is, out of all the ancient gods Dionysos was one of the few who people felt that they could reach out and touch" </em>~ Chapter 4: A God of Many Forms</p><p>Dionysos: Exciter to Frenzy is a phenomenal scholarly exploration of one of the most complex, liminal and paradoxical gods of the ancient world. In this journey through the realms of Dionysos, the author Vikki Bramshaw guides the reader through the mysterious world of the multifaceted Dionysos, revealing his hidden faces and forms, demonstrating his presence in different cultures, the growth cycles of nature, the establishment of theatre and even the ancient Greek calendar.</p><p>The roots of the wine god Dionysos, like his vines, spread throughout the ancient world. From the Cretan Zagreus, to the Thracian Sabazios and the Egyptian Iachen, his stories permeated the myths and traditions of both the untamed wilderness and the culture of cities such as Athens. Joined by slaves and rulers, wild flesh-ripping Maenads and vegetarian Orphics, wine-makers and hunters, the thrice-born Dionysos danced his way through the challenges of rebirth and initiation, with the liberating ecstasy of trance and possession.</p><p>The god Dionysos unites opposites, he is many-formed, dying yet eternal, chthonian and heavenly. His ancient myths, mystical symbols, pagan rites and incarnations represent a uniquely detailed and relevant perspective of the transformation he brings through prophecy and personal liberation which is still relevant today.</p></p><p>Vikki Bramshaw is an author specialising in pre-Christian religion and esoteric traditions. Some of her passions are religious history, theurgy, initiatory rites, and trance. Her first book, 'Craft of the Wise: A Practical Guide' was published with John Hunt Publishing in 2009, after which Vikki wrote for several anthologies with Avalonia including Swaying with the Serpent (featuring in Hekate: Her Sacred Fires, 2010) and 'The Scorpion &amp; the Bridal Bed' (featuring in VS: Thou Art That - That Thou Art, 2011). In this book, 'Dionysos: Exciter to Frenzy', Vikki explores the numerous facets of the god Dionysos revealing the hidden faces of the thrice-born god and the extent of his influence in the mysteries of the ancient world, through the cycles of nature and beyond. Vikki has also completed several courses as part of her ongoing research, including The Origins of Human Behaviour with Oxford University. She is also a trained Holistic Healer with the SHA, a qualified Equine Sports Massage Therapist, and has studied an introductory course in Counselling and Transactional Analysis with Peter Symonds College of Winchester.</p><h2>Blood Libel: On the Trail of an Antisemitic Myth</h2><p><p><b>A landmark history of the antisemitic blood libel myth&#x2015;how it took root in Europe, spread with the invention of the printing press, and persists today.</b></p><p>Accusations that Jews ritually killed Christian children emerged in the mid-twelfth century, following the death of twelve-year-old William of Norwich, England, in 1144. Later, continental Europeans added a destructive twist: Jews murdered Christian children to use their blood. While charges that Jews poisoned wells and desecrated the communion host waned over the years, the blood libel survived.</p><p>Initially blood libel stories were confined to monastic chronicles and local lore. But the development of the printing press in the mid-fifteenth century expanded the audience and crystallized the vocabulary, images, and &#x201c;facts&#x201d; of the blood libel, providing a lasting template for hate. Tales of Jews killing Christians&#x2015;notably Simon of Trent, a toddler whose body was found under a Jewish house in 1475&#x2015;were widely disseminated using the new technology. Following the paper trail across Europe, from England to Italy to Poland, Magda Teter shows how the blood libel was internalized and how Jews and Christians dealt with the repercussions.</p><p>The pattern established in early modern Europe still plays out today. In 2014 the Anti-Defamation League appealed to Facebook to take down a page titled &#x201c;Jewish Ritual Murder.&#x201d; The following year white supremacists gathered in England to honor Little Hugh of Lincoln as a sacrificial victim of the Jews. Based on sources in eight countries and ten languages, <i>Blood Libel</i> captures the long shadow of a pernicious myth.</p></p><p>Magda Teter is Professor of History and Shvidler Chair in Judaic Studies at Fordham University.

As Kent and Mike found out, a decade of major change is not easy on a church. Oak Hills Church, from the pastoral staff to the congregation, had to confront addiction to personal ambition, resist consumerism and reorient their lives around the teachings of Jesus. Their renewed focus on spiritual formation over numerical growth triggered major changes in the content of their sermons, the tenor of their worship services, and the reason for their outreach. They lost members. But the health and spiritual depth of their church today is a testimony of God's transforming work and enduring faithfulness to the people he loves. Honest and humble, this is Kent and Mike's story of a church they love, written to inspire and challenge other churches to let God rewrite their stories as well. Read it for the church you love.</p><p><strong>Kent Carlson</strong> founded Oak Hills Church of Folsom, California, in 1984. For the past thirteen years he has been co-senior pastor of the church with <strong>Mike Lueken.</strong> Mike and Kent are both graduates of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. They each live with their families in the Sacramento, California, area."[This] book provides a view into the evangelical world and culture and some of its struggles. The lessons are transferable to mainline churches facing similar issues." (The Christian Century, October 18, 2011)<br><br>"<em>Renovation of the Church</em> is a modern story of God's influence and following his word, despite the consequences and opinions of others, highly recommended." (James A. Cox, The Midwest Book Review, July 2011)<br><br>"I do not know of a church that has more thoroughly applied what Renovar� cares about to an entire congregation than Oak Hills Church in Folsom, California. Read this book to help your church catalyze the kingdom life of God that is within us and between us." (Lyle Smith Graybeal, coordinator, Renovar� USA)<br><br>"The honest story of two courageous pastors who dared to change the ethos of their church from a membership focus to a discipleship focus, from catering to consumers to creating Christ-followers. Their story will inspire you." (James Bryan Smith, author of The Good and Beautiful God)<br><br>"Bold, courageous, humorous and refreshingly honest! Carlson and Lueken invite us into a journey that few churches would ever attempt&#x2015;shifting their church from a 'consumer driven' church model to a 'disciple-making' church model (a novel idea!). <em>Renovation of the Church</em> is a must-read for every pastor, church leader or seminarian who longs to see the church fulfill the heart of its mission!" (Keith J. Matthews, professor, Graduate School of Theology, Azusa Pacific University)<br><br>"This book is a breath of fresh air that brings with it the aroma of hope&#x2015;hope that maybe, just maybe, there's a different way to do this thing we call church. But more than just a different <em>way,</em> Mike and Kent began with a different <em>desire</em>&#x2015;a desire to be part of a community of faith that was characterized by something beyond success, a community that would actually begin to resemble the character and fragrance of Christ. Their journey toward fulfilling that desire has been a long and difficult one&#x2015;costly too! But if you're like me, you'll find it full . . . of hope." (David Johnson, senior pastor, Church of the Open Door)<br><br>"The release of <em>Renovation of the Church</em> is a bright day for the church. Carlson and Lueken offer a wonderfully candid, bold book about the journey of a church that stopped appealing to religious consumers and started producing disciples of Jesus." (Gary W. Moon, executive director of the Renovar� Institute for Christian Spiritual Formation)<br><br>"The Western church desperately needs conversations around what local church activities look like in light of the gospel of the kingdom: pastoring, outreach, worship, teaching and forming people spiritually. Kent and Mike have done the hard work of thinking about and living these things, helping the rest of us know where to start and what to do." (Jan Johnson, author of Spiritual Disciplines Companion and Invitation to the Jesus Life)<br><br>"Kent Carlson and Mike Lueken love the church&#x2015;not an abstract one, but the one that meets: here and there, down on the corner, or in a warehouse. They love their church. . . . Please read this book and creatively apply it to your situation, with The Teacher beside you. You don't need more money or new facilities. Just begin where you are and all else will take care of itself. No, God will take care of it."

Creatures of all varieties begin inside an egg--and those eggs also come in all shapes and sizes. From a squiggly tadpole to fuzzy robin to a leathery platypus, this charming text and unique illustrations show eight different animals as they begin life. With a cut-out on each page, readers will have fun guessing . . . what will hatch?</p><p>A perfect baby gift for springtime (or anytime!), this unique book from talented author-illustrator duo Jennifer Ward and Susie Ghahremani is sure to delight younger readers with its vivid illustrations and interactive, hands-on format.</p></p><p>Award-winning author <b>JENNIFER WARD</b> and award-winning artist <b>SUSIE GHAHREMANI </b>are the creators of the wildly popular parenting book <i>I LOVE DIRT! 52 Activities to Help You &amp; Your Child Discover the Wonders of Nature, </i>which has been featured in <i>Parenting</i> magazine, <i>Real Simple</i> Magazine, and on National Public Radio. Jennifer Ward has authored several picture books, including her recent <i>There Was an Old Pirate Who Swallowed a Fish. </i>Susie Ghahremani is the founder of boygirlparty�, a whimsically illustrated stationery and gift brand with more than 300 products, that are popular everywhere from independent boutiques, galleries, and retailers such as Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and Nordstrom. <i>What Will Hatch?</i> was Susie's debut picture book.PreS-Using minimal text, Ward introduces seven animals that hatch from eggs-sea turtle, penguin, tadpole, crocodile, robin, caterpillar, and platypus. The first spread includes a two to three word "clue," and the question, "What Will Hatch?" On the second spread, the clue's rhyme is completed and the answer is provided in words and illustration (e.g., "SANDY ball./WHAT will HATCH?/PADDLE and CRAWL-/SEA TURTLE."). The book is designed for use with very young children, and the illustrations are dominant. Ghahremani's folk-art gouache paintings on wood, in soft blues, browns, and greens, are filled with patterns and animals with softly rounded bodies-several in cartoon style. A die-cut hole in each sequence denotes the shape of the creature's egg and is placed among other painted eggs. Unfortunately, the sizes are not to scale. For example, the robin's egg is larger than an extra-large chicken egg, while the platypus's resembles a small pistachio nut. The dark-brown text, hand-printed letters, with some words in all capitals, some in lowercase cursive, often does not blend well with the soft illustrations. The male emperor penguin incubates its single egg in an "egg pouch" on top of its feet, as indicated in the brief endnotes on each species. However, it has a fancy crown of feathers and distinctive black, white, and yellow coloring rather than the rounded head and brown shading of the bird in the paintings. Moreover, the concept of this book will be lost on the tots to whom it is targeted.-Susan Scheps, formerly at Shaker Heights Public Library, OH&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Check out Anne Rice's new race of undead bloodsuckers, independent of the Lestat series. Her alterna-vamp books began with <i>Pandora</i>, but the second of her New Tales of the Vampires, <i>Vittorio</i>, is truly a new beginning--a more controlled story and probably the best of her last half-dozen books.<p> Rice has called <i>Vittorio</i> her vampire version of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. The hunky Vittorio is sweet 16 and "incalculably rich" in 15th-century Italy, the epoch of the Medicis and Vittorio's favorite painter, madly passionate Filippo Lippi.

Torn between lust, murderous rage, and vampire thirst, Vittorio is one interestingly troubled soul.</p><p> Rice urges readers to enter Vittorio's world by reading the sources she embroiders, <i>Fra Filippo Lippi</i> and <i>Public Life in Renaissance Florence</i>, and to get a feel for the scary communion Vittorio sees in the Court of the Ruby Grail by listening to <i>All Souls' Vespers</i>. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><br>"Sensuous . . .

Vikram Chandra's novel draws the reader deep into the life of Inspector Sartaj Singh&#x2014;and into the criminal underworld of Ganesh Gaitonde, the most wanted gangster in India.</p><p>Sartaj, one of the very few Sikhs on the Mumbai police force, is used to being identified by his turban, beard and the sharp cut of his trousers. But "the silky Sikh" is now past forty, his marriage is over and his career prospects are on the slide. When Sartaj gets an anonymous tip-off as to the secret hide-out of the legendary boss of G-Company, he's determined that he'll be the one to collect the prize. </p><p>Vikram Chandra's keenly anticipated new novel is a magnificent story of friendship and betrayal, of terrible violence, of an astonishing modern city and its dark side. Drawing inspiration from the classics of nineteenth-century fiction, mystery novels, Bollywood movies and Chandra's own life and research on the streets of Mumbai, <em>Sacred Games</em> evokes with devastating realism the way we live now but resonates with the intelligence and emotional depth of the best of literature. </p></p><p><i>Sacred Games</i> is a novel as big, ambitious, multi-layered, contradictory, funny, sad, scary, violent, tender, complex, and irresistible as India itself. Steep yourself in this story, enjoy the delicious masala Chandra has created, and you will have an idea of how the country manages to hang together despite age-old hatreds, hundreds of dialects, different religious practices, the caste system, and corruption everywhere. The Game keeps it afloat. <p> There are more than a half-dozen subplots to be enjoyed, but the main events take place between Inspector Sartaj Singh, a Sikh member of the Mumbai police force, and Ganesh Gaitonde, the most wanted gangster in India. It is no accident that Ganesh is named for the Hindu god of success, the elephant god much revered by Hindus everywhere. By the world's standards he has made a huge success of his life: he has everything he wants. But soon after the novel begins he is holed up in a bomb shelter from which there is no escape, and Sartaj is right outside the door. Ganesh and Sartaj trade barbs, discuss the meaning of good and evil, hold desultory conversations alternating with heated exchanges, and, finally, Singh bulldozes the building to the ground. He finds Ganesh dead of a gunshot wound, and an unknown woman dead in the bunker along with him. </p><p> How did it come to this? Of course, Singh has wanted to capture this prize for years, but why now and why in this way? The chapters that follow tell both their stories, but especially chronicle Gaitonde's rise to power. He is a clever devil, to be sure, and his tales are as captivating as those of Scheherezade. Like her he spins them out one by one and often saves part of the story for the reader--or Sartaj--to figure out. He is involved in every racket in India, corrupt to the core, but even he is afraid of Swami Shridlar Shukla, his Hindu guru and adviser. In the story Gaitonde shares with Singh and countless other characters, Vikram Chandra has written a fabulous tale of treachery, a thriller, and a tour of the mean streets of India, complete with street slang. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i> </p><p> <strong>Questions for Vikram Chandra</strong> </p><p> After writing his first two, critically acclaimed books, <i>Red Earth and Pouring Rain</i> and <i>Love and Longing in Bombay</i>, Vikram Chandra set off on what became, seven years later, an epic story of crime and punishment in modern Mumbai, <i>Sacred Games</i>. Chandra splits his time between Berkeley, where he teaches at the University of California, and Mumbai, the vast city that becomes a character in its own right in <i>Sacred Games</i>. We asked him a few questions about his new book. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Did you imagine your book would become such an epic when you began it? </p><p><strong>Vikram Chandra:</strong> No, not at all. When I began, I imagined a conventional crime story which began with a dead body or two, proceeded along a linear path, and ended 300 pages later with a neatly-wrapped solution. But when I began to actually investigate the particular kind of crime that I was interested in, a series of connections revealed themselves. Organized crime is of course connected to politics, both local and national, but if you're interested in political activity in India today--and elsewhere in the world--you are of course going to have to address the role of religion. These realms, in turn, intersect with the workings of the film and television industries. And all of this exists within the context of the "Great Game," the struggle between nation-states for power and dominance; some of the criminal organizations have mutually-beneficial relationships with intelligence agencies. So, I became really interested in this mesh of interlocking lives and organizations and historical forces. I began to trace how ordinary people were thrown about and forced to make choices by events and actors very far away; how disparate lives can cross each other--sometimes unknowingly--and change profoundly as a result. The form of the novel grew from this thematic interest, in an attempt to form a representation of this intricate web. The reader will, I hope, by the end of the novel see how the connections fall together and weave through each other. The individual characters, of course, see only a fragmented, partial version of this whole. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You interviewed many gangsters, high and low, to research your story. How did you get introductions to them? What did they think of someone writing their life? </p><p><strong>Chandra:</strong> When I was writing my last book, <i>Love and Longing in Bombay</i> (in which Sartaj Singh first appears), I had contacted some police officers and crime journalists. I stayed in touch with a few of them, and when I began to think seriously about this project I asked them to introduce me to anyone who could tell me something about organized crime. Amongst the people I met in this way were some people from the "underworld," which turns out not to be an underworld at all. It's the same world we live in, inhabited by human beings who are very much like the rest of us, even in their distinctiveness. For the most part, they were as curious about me and what I was doing as I was about them. They're not big novel readers, but they had very certain opinions about representations of their lives they had seen on the big screen: "Such-and-such film got it all wrong"--they would tell me--"don't do that." And, "This was correct, that was not." So I listened, and I hope I got it mostly right. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> For most American readers--like me--your story is full of slang and cultural references that we can't hope to follow. For me that's part of the charm--I feel like I'm immersed in a world I don't fully understand. Were you thinking of a particular audience as you wrote? </p><p><strong>Chandra:</strong> I wanted to use the English that we actually speak in India, the language that I would use to tell this story if I were sitting in a bar in Mumbai talking to a friend. This English would be sprinkled with words from many Indian languages, and we would share a universe of cultural referents and facts that a reader from another country wouldn't recognize instantly. This, of course, is an experience that all of us have in a very various world. I remember reading British children's stories as a kid, and having long discussions with friends about what "crumpets" and "clotted cream" could possibly be. An Indian reader reading a novel about Arizona by an American writer might have no idea what a "pueblo" was, or why you went to a "Circle-K" to get a bottle of milk. But the context tells you something about what is being referred to, and there is a distinct delight in discovering a new world and figuring out its nuances. This is one of the great gifts of reading, that it can transport you into foreign landscapes. It's one of the reasons I read books from other cultures and places, and I hope American readers will share in this pleasure. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Your book has dozens of characters who could live in books of their own. Aside from your two main figures, the policeman Sartaj Singh and the criminal Ganesh Gaitone, which was your favorite character to write? </p><p><strong>Chandra:</strong> That would have to be Sartaj's mother, Prabhjot Kaur, as a young girl in pre-Partition India, I think. She's curious, innocent, and passionate; writing that chapter was hard and exhilarating. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The movies of Bollywood (and Hollywood) are everywhere in your story, and many in your family (and you yourself) have been screenwriters and directors. For someone new to Indian film, what are some of your favorites you'd recommend? </p><p><strong>Chandra:</strong> A very small sampling from the '50s onwards might be: <i>Pyaasa</i> (<i>Thirst</i>, 1957); <i>Kaagaz ke Phool</i> ("Paper Flowers," 1959); <i>Mughal-e-Azam</i> ("The Great Mughal," 1960); <i>Sholay</i> ("Embers," 1975); <i>Parinda</i> ("Bird," 1989); <i>Satya</i> (1998); <i>Lagaan</i> ("Land Tax," 2001); <i>Lage Raho Munnabha</i> ("Keep at it, Munnabhai," 2006). </p><p>Vikram Chandra is the author of the novel <em>Red Earth</em> and <em>Pouring Rain</em> (Commonwealth Writers' Prize; David Higham Prize), and the short story collection <em>Love and Longing in Bombay</em> (Commonwealth Writers' Prize; <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book).

When Hannan is found dead at the base of the cliffs that overlook the Atlantic, Molly's suspicions are quickly justified, and as much as she wants to keep her promise to Daniel that she won't do any more sleuthing now, there isn't much she can do once the chase is on.

Rain swept in great squalls off the ocean, snatching the words from my mouth. It was not a night to be standing on a clifftop in complete darkness. Our umbrella had given up the unequal struggle with the storm on the way from the station and now lay in a rubbish bin, its ribs sticking out like a large dead spider. Daniel had deposited it there despite my protests, stating that it was past all hope of repair.<br>It was a long walk from the station and not one that should have been attempted on a stormy night. But we had little choice. The directions we had been given were for a delightful afternoon stroll along a cliff path, with blue ocean below us. We had not anticipated that Daniel would be delayed with a last minute problem at headquarters and that what the locals called a nor&#x2019;easter would arrive at the same time as ourselves.<br>After changing trains in Providence, then again to a branch line in Kingston, we finally pulled into Newport station, at almost ten o&#x2019;clock. There was not a hansom cab or any kind of conveyance to be found. The town appeared to be battened down in anticipation of the coming storm. We&#x2019;d set off bravely enough under Daniel&#x2019;s big umbrella but once out of the town center, heading toward the clifftop footpath the full force of the wind had turned the umbrella inside out and ripped it to shreds in minutes.<br>&#x201c;Damn and blast it,&#x201d; Daniel had muttered, no longer apologizing if he swore in my presence now that I was married to him. &#x201c;We should have waited for the morning. I should not have listened to you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What, and missed a whole day of our honeymoon?&#x201d; I demanded as I struggled to take off my new hat. It was a jaunty little concoction piled high with ribbons and lace and I certainly didn&#x2019;t want to lose it over the cliff. I stuffed it into my carpetbag, probably not doing it much good in the process but at least preventing it from sailing off into the ocean. &#x201c;Cheer up. I&#x2019;m sure it can&#x2019;t be far. Newport is only a small seaside town, isn&#x2019;t it? Just a few cottages, I was told.&#x201d;<br>Daniel had to chuckle at this and put an arm around my shoulders. &#x201c;You wait until daylight and then you&#x2019;ll see the extent of the cottages.&#x201d;<br>In my mind&#x2019;s eye I pictured a long road like the one leading into Westport in Ireland, with simple whitewashed cottages stretching along the side of the road facing the sea. It would be nice to be spending my honeymoon in a place that reminded me of home, I had thought when Daniel told me of this opportunity.<br>The walk turned from an annoyance into a frightening experience. We tried to follow a dark little street called Cliff Avenue, but it ended in a pair of high, locked gates, forcing us back to our original route along the cliff&#x2014;not what we would have chosen on a dark night. No lights shone out through the storm and we could hear the pounding waves crashing onto rocks below us. That cliff path seemed to go on forever and even I began to doubt the sense of wanting to reach our cottage tonight. Luckily the wind was blowing in from the ocean or I should have worried about being swept over that unseen cliff edge to our deaths.<br>&#x201c;Are you sure this is the right way?&#x201d; I shouted, grabbing on to Daniel&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Are there no roads in this place? Is this cottage not on a proper street?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Obviously,&#x201d; Daniel said tersely. &#x201c;But it never occurred to me to ask for foul weather directions. I assumed there would be a cab if we needed one.&#x201d;<br>I peered into the blackness. &#x201c;There are no lights. We can&#x2019;t be near any cottages. Surely the whole population of Newport doesn&#x2019;t go to bed by nine o&#x2019;clock?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s October. None of the cottages are likely to be inhabited at this time of year,&#x201d; Daniel shouted back. &#x201c;They are only used in the summer.&#x201d;<br>The thought of being the only people in a remote seaside village had seemed desirable when Daniel had presented it to me, our original honeymoon plans having fallen through when Daniel was summoned back to work two days after our wedding. I had borne this with remarkable patience for once, understanding that this was to be the lot of a policeman&#x2019;s wife. I think Daniel had been impressed by my stoicism and had promised me that we would escape from the city as soon as his work permitted. So when the offer of a seaside cottage had come up, he&#x2019;d jumped at it. Of course October was a little late in the year for beaches and bathing, but we had other activities in mind anyway. And this part of the country often experienced what they called an Indian summer, with glorious sunny days and glowing fall colors. Just not this year, it appeared.<br>&#x201c;Nearly there, I think.&#x201d; Daniel propelled me forward, his arm still around my waist. &#x201c;Then a bath and a hot drink will soon bring us to rights. Ah, this way. I believe we follow this wall and it will lead us to the gate.&#x201d;<br>As Daniel took my hand and guided me away from the cliff path, there was an ominous rumble of thunder overhead. A few moments later a flash of lightning lit up towering wrought-iron gates. Daniel felt for a latch but the gates refused to open.<br>&#x201c;Blast and damnation!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;These infernal gates must open somehow.&#x201d; He shook them in frustration but they refused to budge.<br>&#x201c;They knew we were expected today, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any lights.&#x201d; I was soaked to the skin, my teeth chattering now, my hair plastered to my face, and my clothes clinging to me. All I wanted was to get indoors to a fire and a cup of tea.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand it. I know the family is not usually here at this time of year, but there has to be a caretaker on the property,&#x201d; Daniel snapped out the words. &#x201c;But we have no way of alerting anyone, unless we walk back into town and see if we can reach the place by telephone.&#x201d;<br>This suggestion didn&#x2019;t seem too appealing. &#x201c;Everything seemed to be closed for the night in town. Besides we can&#x2019;t walk all the way back,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re already soaked to the skin. I don&#x2019;t suppose it&#x2019;s any good shouting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No one would hear us with this infernal racket going on.&#x201d;<br>Thunder growled again and once again the scene was illuminated with a lighting flash. It revealed a long driveway behind those gates and in the distance the great black shape of what seemed to be an enormous castle. I stared in amazement.<br>&#x201c;I thought you said it was a cottage.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wanted to surprise you,&#x201d; Daniel replied in an annoyed voice. &#x201c;The wealthy who own summer homes in Newport call them cottages but they are actually mansions. This one is called Connemara.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Holy mother of God,&#x201d; I muttered. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not getting a whole mansion to ourselves are we?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, we&#x2019;ve been offered the guest cottage on the property. If only we can find a way in.&#x201d; He rattled the gates again angrily.<br>I had been experiencing a growing sense of anxiety. It wasn&#x2019;t just the howl of the storm and the flashes of lightning. God knows I&#x2019;d seen enough storms on the West Coast of Ireland. It was something more. &#x201c;Daniel, don&#x2019;t let&#x2019;s stay here,&#x201d; I blurted out suddenly. &#x201c;Perhaps we should go back into town after all. There is bound to be a hotel or inn of some sort where we can spend the night. The house clearly doesn&#x2019;t want us.&#x201d;<br>Daniel gave me a quizzical smile. &#x201c;The house doesn&#x2019;t want us?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting this overwhelming feeling that we shouldn&#x2019;t be here, that we&#x2019;re not wanted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You and your sixth sense,&#x201d; Daniel said. He was still prowling, staring up at the gates and the high stone wall. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll feel differently when we&#x2019;re safely inside. I am determined to find a way in, even if I have to scale that wall.&#x201d;<br>A great clap of thunder right overhead drowned out his last words and simultaneously the world was bathed in electric blue light. I was staring up at the house and I saw a face quite clearly framed in an upstairs window. It was a child&#x2019;s face and it was laughing with maniacal glee.<br>I let go of the bars of the gate as if burned. &#x201c;Come away!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Rhys Bowen<br></p><h2>Creation in Six Days: A Defense of the Traditional Reading of Genesis One</h2><p><i>Creation in Six Days</i> offers an exegetical, literary, and theological defense of the traditional interpretation of the Genesis account of six-day creation.

As such, it is a basic work in modern spirituality, one of the great devotional treatises which have shaped the history of Catholic prayer life. The characteristic gifts of the devout writer, his elevation of thought and directness of expression, are admirably exemplified in the beloved pages of his Marian masterpiece. The translators are to be warmly thanked for the fidelity and felicity of their English version; it keeps remarkably the spirit and the simplicity of Saint John s original work. <p>Richard J. Cushing, D.D., Archbishop of Boston</p></p><p>Saint John Eudes has been called the wonder of his age. Missionary, founder, reformer of the clergy, he crowded into a life of seventy-nine years so many and varied accomplishments that one marvels how a single man could achieve so much. In addition to the activities of an incessant and many-sided apostolate, he wrote a number of valuable books, which rank him among the most prolific ascetic writers of the seventeenth century. <p>Saint John Eudes was born at Ri, a country parish near Caen, Normandy, in 1601. Endowed with extraordinary talents, and filled with burning zeal for the salvation of souls, he devoted 50 years of life, until his death in 1689, to the preaching of missions and to the organization of ecclesiastical seminaries. He founded the Congregation of Jesus and Mary, generally known as the Eudist Father, for missionary and seminary work; the Order of Our Lay of Charity with its two observances of the Refuge and of the Good Shepherd; the Society of the Most Admirable Heart for lay persons aspiring to perfection in the world; and lastly, Confraternities of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary for the propagation among the faithful of the devotion, for which he was the first apostle. He wrote the first Mass and Office for the special feast in honor of the Sacred Heart and of the Holy Heart of Mary, which he established thirty years before the revelations of the Sacred Heart to Saint Margaret Mary.</p>One of the most prolific ascetical writers of the seventeenth century, Saint John Eudes was an inexhaustible reservoir of holy wisdom and devotional fervor. Loreto Publications considers it a foremost priority to help make the spiritual doctrine of this great apostle of devotion to the Sacred and Admirable Hearts of Jesus and Mary more widely known. Perhaps no book of his better exemplifies that profoundly incarnational doctrine than The Admirable Heart of Mary. Eudes reveals to his disciples this most pure and maternal of all hearts both in its corporal and spiritual pulsations, while demonstrating with a dozen unforgettable natural and scriptural analogies, how this human heart was so inexhaustibly divinized by the one Divine Heart of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. The Admirable Heart of Mary was given to us from the Cross by Jesus Christ. Truly this heart was the first-fruit of His Passion, given to all of Mary s children, that it might be honored, cherished, invoked and, ultimately, with that of her Son, reproduced in them. This is the essence of the spirituality of Saint John Eudes. --Loreto Publications</p><h2>A Concise Introduction to World Religions</h2><p>Based on the best-selling <em>World Religions: Eastern Traditions</em> and <em>World Religions: Western Traditions,</em> <em>A Concise Introduction to World Religions,</em> Fourth Edition, is ideal for single-semester courses.

Brown charts the rise to prominence of a religion that began as an obscure sect in Roman Judaea and developed into Europe&#x2019;s dominant religious &#x2013; and political &#x2013; institution. Christianity played a pivotal role in the making of Europe, as well as the delineation of its boundaries: the political gulf between Europe and its eastern neighbors was also a religious divide.

The massive pressure on CIOs continues to increase as the opportunities to use technology in business become more prevalent and more competitive. As CIOs often find themselves at the center of business conflict, they must not only familiarize themselves with Machiavellian tactics as a defensive weapon, but also learn to use them as an offensive weapon in extreme situations so that they can increase IT's contribution to their enterprises.&nbsp; </p> <p>As Italian political philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli implied, you're either predator or prey, and the animal you most resemble determines your position on the food chain. In The Wolf in CIO's Clothing Gartner analyst and author Tina Nunno expands on Machiavelli's metaphor, examining seven animal types and the leadership attributes of each. Nunno posits the wolf -- a social animal with strong predatory instincts -- as the ideal example of how a leader can adapt and thrive.&nbsp; </p> <p>Technology may be black and white, but successful leadership demands an ability to exist in the grey. Drawing on her experience with hundreds of CIOs, Nunno charts a viable way to master the Machiavellian principles of power, manipulation, love, and war. Through compelling case studies, her approach demonstrates how CIOs and IT leaders can adjust their leadership styles in extreme situations for their own success and that of their teams.</p></p><p><b>Tina Nunno</b> is a Vice President and Gartner Fellow in Gartner's CIO Research group based in Stamford, Connecticut.

The hedge is the symbolic boundary between the two worlds and this book will teach you how to cross that hedge. While hedge riding, the hedge rider's consciousness travels to another place, the otherworld, which is also the realm of the collective unconscious. There the rider guided by his or her animal and spirit guides, encounters archetypal symbols and assimilates this knowledge to help guide her or him on their pathway.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> This book is an experiential guide,&nbsp;as Aristotle said, 'For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them'.&nbsp;Learning by experiencing is about trusting your instincts and connecting with your inner spirit.&nbsp;The hedge riding aspect of hedge witchery is perhaps the most difficult part of the hedge witch pathway.

But these stories aren't sedate, scholarly works. They're action-packed, fast-paced, high-drama adventures, with monsters, romance, and not a few huge explosions. O'Connor's vibrant, kinetic art brings ancient tales to undeniable life, in a perfect fusion of super-hero aesthetics and ancient Greek mythology. </p><p>Volume 1 of OLYMPIANS, ZEUS: King OF THE GODS, introduces readers to the ruler of the Olympian Pantheon, telling his story from his boyhood to his ascendance to supreme power. This title has Common Core connections.</p></p><p><b>George O'Connor</b> is an author, illustrator and cartoonist. His first graphic novel, <i>Journey Into Mohawk Country</i>, used as its sole text the actual historical journal of the seventeenth-century Dutch trader Harmen Meyndertsz van den Bogaert, and told the true story of how New York almost wasn't. He followed that up with <i>Ball Peen Hammer</i>, the first graphic novel written by playwright Adam Rapp, a dark, dystopian view of a society's collapse. Now he has brought his attention to Olympians, an ongoing series retelling the classic Greek myths in comics form. In addition to his graphic novel career, O'Connor has published several children's picture books, including the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling <i>Kapow</i>, <i>Sally and the Some-Thing</i>, and <i>Uncle Bigfoot</i>. He lives in Brooklyn, NY.<p>&#x201c;O'Connor unveils his new Olympians graphic-novel series with this story of the daddy of Greek gods. Most immediately striking about this, aside from the exciting artwork, is the care O'Connor takes to visualize the creation myth that begins with Gaea creating and taking as a husband the sky, Ouranos. Their children-the Titans and other proto-Olympian entities-are often neglected or at best murkily covered, but here they're vividly portrayed with all the magnificence of their beyond-good-and-evil power. After this breathtaking and lengthy sequence, Zeus enters the scene to grow from a feisty nymph-needling youth to a lightning bolt-wielding avenger. The extended, earth-shattering battle he wages with his father, Kronos, takes up the bulk of the story, delivering page after page of cataclysmic blows with the sensibility and hyperkinetic pacing of a literary superhero comic. While O'Connor includes a generous bounty of bonus materials to gratify myth hounds, this series could well become the initiation point for a new cadre of acolytes. New volumes should come quickly, with Athena's book due in April 2010.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;O'Connor (Kapow!; Journey into Mohawk Country) embarks on a new project: a series of graphic novels for young readers about Greek mythology (Athena: Grey-Eyed Goddess follows in April, with Hera and Hades in the pipeline). While the D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths is the gold standard for illustrated introductions to Greek mythology, O'Connor offers a modern take with a new view of these "original superhero stories" with gritty yet heroic art and spare prose that lets the myths speak for themselves. The story is the one most schoolchildren know-the Titans created Zeus and Hera, as well as the Cyclopes, and adventure ensued-but O'Connor brings the young gods to life with memorable compositions and attention to detail (childlike fear on Hera's face as she navigates the treacherous new world, a bat screeching away as Zeus confronts the Cyclopes). Back matter includes notes, a bibliography, a list of recommended books for further reading, and discussion questions for readers, making it attractive for teachers and librarians for its information and depth of research. But that shouldn't stop tweens from enjoying the story. Ages 9-12.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;An energetic graphic series on classical mythology debuts with the origin story of the Big Cheese Olympian, Zeus. Appropriately heightened, stately language narrates the joining of Gaea with Ouranos, the Titans' rise to power and Kronos's devouring of all his children but one-Zeus (pictured with lots of muscles and, oddly enough, Nordic blond good looks). In contrast (and in the same spirit as G. Brian Karas's rendition of the King of the Gods's story for younger readers, Young Zeus, also 2009), speech-balloon dialogue is decidedly colloquial: "Hey Metis. How about a kiss?" O'Connor pulls out the comic-book stops in his artwork, consciously echoing superteam portraits of yore in his line-up of angry Olympians and allowing the Clash of the Titans to extend over pages and pages of hugely satisfying sound effects, crumbled mountains and thrown lighting bolts. He plants clues in both text and images to stories to be developed as the series continues. Extensive backmatter includes an author's note, full-page character profiles, "G[r]eek Notes," discussion questions ("Has your dad ever tried to eat you?") and a bibliography. Holy Cyclopes, here's a keeper.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Here it is! The book you've been waiting for: the first in a 12-book graphic novel series about the Greek gods, called Olympians. And it's just in time to satiate the kids waiting anxiously for The Lightning Thief's movie release (and aimed at the same age readers). Going back to sources from antiquity, including Homer and Hesiod, George O'Connor begins his story with the creation of the gods and lays the foundation for their famous jealousies and rash actions. For starters, Ouranos (the sky), husband to Gaea (Mother Earth), favors his Titan offspring ("They were ageless and beautiful and so tall that their heads scraped the sky") over the one-eyed Cyclopes and Hekatonchieres (each of which has 50 heads and 100 hands). So Ouranos condemns the latter two lines to a chasm deep within the earth. Gaea (pronounced GHEE-uh), however, wants all of her children to be free. So, at her urging and with Kronos in the lead, the Titans "cut open the sky" and drain Ouranos of power. Much to Gaea's dismay, Kronos, now ruler of the Titans, "has too much of his father in him," and he, too, refuses to free his brothers below the earth. So she appeals to the next generation--Zeus.</p><p>O'Connor, who early on demonstrated his love of comics with his debut picture book, Kapow!, taps into the more complex visual characterizations he explored in his artwork for last fall's Ball Peen Hammer (by Adam Rapp) here. Kronos and Zeus, even at their most chilling, never lose their dimension or their charisma. The artist uses long vertical cartoon panels in wine, rust and midnight-blue tones to emphasize the commanding grace of the Titans, as well as the "new life" that arises from the drops of Ouranos's blood (and the text plants seeds to further installments: "What came from that [pink froth] is a tale for another day"). The first sight of a maturing Zeus warrants a full page and a much lighter palette in terra cotta, forest green and robin's egg blue. Eight equal panels chronicle Zeus's transformation into an eagle ("To be an Olympian... was to be able to change shape as others change their mind"), and when Zeus meets Metis (a daughter to Oceanus and future mother of Athena), the story shifts from the omniscient narrator's voice to direct dialogue between the pair. But the climactic duel between Kronos and Zeus (father and son) is O'Connor's crowning achievement here. While carefully adhering to the Greek legends, O'Connor endows these mythic characters with a freshness and magnetism that will attract even today's visually savvy youth.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gr 4 Up-This 12-volume series debuts with the origins of Zeus. O'Connor begins his retelling by starting from literally nothing. Then a simple brown circle introduces readers to Gaea, or Mother Earth. The creation of Olympians unfolds slowly with simple straightforward lines and silhouettes. Dark browns and blacks echo the early development of the Titans. The first fully rendered face is that of the infant Zeus, with his birth symbolized in a pastel palette. This new race of Gods is visually and strikingly different. Zeus's virility and vitality both bring the story to life and make it accessible to young readers. Zeus's encounters with gods, particularly his battle with his father Kronos, are visually compelling. Images of grasping hands, thunderbolts, close-up visages, gaping holes in the earth, and silhouetted bodies bring Zeus's struggle for dominance into clear focus. Oversize panels reinforce the heroic proportions of the story. It is telling that from such a simple beginning, the complex story is able to evolve naturally to a satisfying conclusion, as depicted on the final page showing Zeus and the new race of numerous immortal gods. O'Connor clearly hints throughout the retelling that more stories are forthcoming: "And that is a tale for another day." Endpapers show the Olympian Family Tree. Back matter includes an author's note, notation of Greek words, discussion questions, and recommended reading. This ultimate superhero story will appeal to anyone who enjoys Greek mythology or great comic art.&#x201d; &#x2015;Barbara M. Moon, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY, <i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Readers who find Edith Hamilton-styled myth retellings just a tad too stately or a touch too solemn will be delighted with this debut title in the Olympians series of graphic novels. O'Connor takes his subject seriously, adhering closely to Hesiod's <i>Theogony; </i>he ramps it up with artwork that retains the majesty of a creation story while sparkling with dashes of comic-book humor that nestle readers right into a comfort zone. Beginning with Gaea's creation of her heavenly mate, Ouranos, he launches into the epically dysfunctional family drama that is the story of their belligerent offspring. These ur-creatures, regal and monumental, seem to be chiseled out of elemental earth itself, but teens who are immersed, or even slightly dipped, in contemporary comics will also recognize that carefully staged group poses of the Titans and Kronos' six children recall superhero teams mustering their forces to kick some cosmic butt. It's this balance between respect for myth and adherence to comic-book form that works so wonderfully well here: Zeus is every inch the ripped stud, equally adept at warfare and womanizing; Metis, who helps him conquer his child-consuming father, is a not-as-ditzy-as-she-looks blonde; and Hera, Zeus' sister and wife, is both a vulnerable rescued maiden and a no-nonsense queen.

Bucky is Rob's temperamental, buck-toothed Siamese cat with a penchant for mischief, a hatred of ferrets, and a love of rubber bands.

Classics Illustrated tells this wonderful tale in colorful comic strip form, providing an excellent introduction for younger readers. Also includes theme discussions and study questions.</p><p>This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..." <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. <i>--Craig E.

Inside these pages some of the biggest (and smallest) mysteries of the natural world are explained in essays by real working scientists, which are then illustrated by artists given free rein to be as literal or as imaginative as they like. The result is a celebration of the wonder that inspires every new discovery.

Volvovski and her coauthors selected 75 not quite answerable questions--from "Where did life come from?" to "Why do cats purr?" to "How does gravity work?"--and let artists and scientists loose on them. The artists created whimsical illustrations, and the scientists responded with thoughtful essays." - <b>Smithsonian.com</b><br><br>"Far from the brassy computer renderings of cosmic events, for instance, in these pages you'll see star births described in pen and ink, antimatter realized in collage, and a hand-painted black hole."&nbsp;-<b><i> Discover Magazine</i></b><br><br><b>A New York Times Bestseller in Science and Non-Fiction E-books!&nbsp;</b><br><br>"The result is scientific, yet with tongue planted firmly in cheek.&nbsp;<i>Why do we blush?</i>&nbsp;includes a discussion of blood vessels and the sympathetic nervous system, along with a drawing of a naked man with his internal organs exposed (you'd blush too)." - Cassandra Willyard, <b>WNYC's Studio 360</b><br><br>"75 contemporary artists such as&nbsp;Jacob Magraw,&nbsp;Jen Corace, and&nbsp;Patrick Kyle&nbsp;were commissioned to create the book's original artwork, leading to a huge variety of visual styles throughout.

Illustrated with rare and unusual factory photos and period ads, the Willys-Overland saga begins in 1903 when the Standard Wheel Company began making Overland cars. Soon after, auto dealer John North Willys was forced by circumstances to rescue the failing Overland company. By 1916 Willys had become the second-best selling car in the world. Prospering in the '20s but then bankrupt a decade later, the firm crawled back from the edge in time to win the all-important Jeep contract that ensured Willys would survive. Even after Kaiser Motors bought Willys in 1953 its products were still branded Willys until 1963 when the name was phased out. The final new Willys Jeep introduced - the Wagoneer - became a legend in its own right. Also covered are the pre-war coupes modified into high-powered racers. </p></p><p><p>One of America&#x2019;s best-known automotive writers,<b> Patrick R.

Forward offers practical, proven, step-by-step methods for healing the wounds caused by his deception and betrayal. She provides all the communication and behavioral techniques you need to deal with a lover's lies, telling you exactly what to say, when and how to respond to his reactions, and how to present your requirements for staying in the relationship. With understanding and compassion, she helps you decide whether your relationship can be saved and shows you how to move beyond doubt and regret if you feel that it can't. But whether you stay or go, you can learn to love and trust again.</p></p><p><p>Susan Forward, PhD, is an internationally renowned therapist, lecturer, and author. Her books include the number-one <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them</em> and <em>Toxic Parents</em>. In addition to her private practice, she has served as a therapist, instructor, and consultant in numerous Southern California psychiatric and medical facilities.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p> When Your Lover is a Liar<p></p><p>The Labyrinth of Lying</p><p>*You answer the phone to hear a woman on the other end say, "Is this Betty? I thought it was time you knew that your husband and I have been seeing each other for the past two years. He doesn't love you. Why don't you just let him go?"</p><p>*You get a notice from the bank that a check you wrote has bounced. You indignantly call the bank, certain that you have eight or ten times that amount in the account you share with your husband. You're told you're overdrawn--and you know you didn't spend all the money.</p><p>*Your live-in lover swears he's stopped drinking and has been attending AA meetings regularly--and then you find a bottle of Scotch hidden in his tool chest.</p><p>Suddenly you've got vertigo. The world you thought you knew is spinning. Your mind races: Who is this person I thought I could trust? How many other lies have there been? You've been socked in the stomach. You don't know if you have a future with this man--and you wonder if you can believe anything he said in the past. All you know for certain is this: Your lover is a liar.</p><p>At this agonizing, bewildering time, finding a rational response is crucial--an important relationship hangs in the balance, and so does your own well-being. Yet no matter how alert we may be, most of us have no idea what steps to take when we encounter lies on this most intimate ground. Most of us don't have a clue about how to confront and counter the poison of a lover's lie. Faced with the disorientation of deception and betrayal, we tend to bounce between two extremes: we may deny and rationalize away our partner's behavior, or become so enraged we can't think. People who care about us may be yelling "Dump him!"--and we turn ballistic, losing our perspective in a fit of anger. Neither path brings us peace or lasting satisfaction.</p><p>All too often our lovers' lies leave us paralyzed. We find ourselves unable to make even the simplest decisions with our partners, because trust has disappeared, and we don't know when or if they are telling us the truth. We don't know what's real anymore, and we suffer terribly. A relationship with a liar can destroy our self-respect and our ability to trust our own perceptions and judgments. In the worst instances, an otherwise loving woman can become bitter, guarded, and walled-off, afraid to open her heart for fear of being betrayed again.</p><p>A friend of mine recently summed up the dilemma many a woman has faced: "I trusted my boyfriend more than I've ever trusted anyone," she told me, "and then I found out he was still sleeping with an old girlfriend while he was telling me he loved me. I'm afraid I can never trust another man again."</p><p>Lying by a lover is frequently one of the most destructive forces in a woman's life.</p><p>But it doesn't have to be.</p><p>There is a way through the labyrinth of lying in love relationships, and I'd like to give you a map to this subterranean world within a world. In the pages that follow, I will deal with the full range of lies, from the benign to the lethal, and introduce you to the many varieties of liars--from those who'd never admit what they're doing to the chronic confessors who encourage us to forgive and forget. I'll also give you a detailed profile of the one kind of liar you must leave immediately.</p><p>I will show you some of the forces that drive men to lie, how they behave, and how to stop them early on. In the second half of this book, I will give you specific communication skills and behavioral strategies that will go a long way toward helping you reground a relationship in honesty or, when that is not possible, decide when to leave a partner who lies. Whatever your situation, I will help you identify your best course of action, and I will support you through the process of bringing truth, self-trust, and intimacy back into your life.</p><p></p><p>A Diagram of Deception</p><p>The words lie and liar are ugly. It's heartbreaking to have to use them to describe someone you love or are interested in, because they're loaded with pain and anger. They put you face-to-face with betrayal and malevolence when what you thought you had was intimacy. The words themselves are so inflammatory that it's important not to use them casually.</p><p>Certainly not every man is a liar, not every liar is a man, and not every thoughtless act is a lie. But in this book I'm focusing specifically on men who lie to women because I've seen how resistant women tend to be to acknowledging that the men they love lie to them. Women suffer uniquely when lies pop up in a relationship because, as we'll see, when a man lies to a woman, both of them blame her.</p><p>When I use the word liar, I'm not talking about men who mislead us inadvertently (because of oversights or misunderstandings) or with optimistic but unrealistic promises (like "I'll meet you at six" when they're not sure they can even get off work before seven).</p><p>And I'm not talking about the harmless little white lies that we all tell or shading the truth to protect a person from something painful. Most of us use flattery and exaggeration in our day-to-day interactions, and life could be pretty cruel if we didn't. The whole truth and nothing but the truth is fine in the courtroom, but we all try to soften otherwise harsh realities. We meet a friend we haven't seen in a few years and diplomatically say, "You look great--you haven't changed a bit," even as we're thinking, "God, you've got jowls just like your mother's, and the same bad taste in clothes." Do our words convey the whole truth? Of course not. But is a lie like this worth worrying about? I don't think so.</p></p><h2>The Autobiography of Mrs. Tom Thumb: A Novel (Random House Reader&#39;s Circle)</h2><p><b>For anyone who loves the historical novels of Sara Gruen, Geraldine Brooks, and E.

I was in my own home, in my own bed. Safe.</p><p>Oscar, my ersatz witch&#x2019;s familiar&#x2014;a shape-shifting cross between a gargoyle and a goblin&#x2014;perched on my brass bedstead, leaning over to peer at me. His fearsome face was upside down and his breath smelled vaguely of cheese.</p><p>Soaked and shivering, I let out a shaky sigh. I wasn&#x2019;t sweaty from fear, but dripping wet&#x2014;and smelling of brine&#x2014;as though I had, indeed, just emerged from the San Francisco Bay.</p><p>&#x201c;I had a nightmare,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, no kiddin&#x2019;. That&#x2019;s one heck of a nightmare if you&#x2019;re manifesting in your sleep. Were you swimming or something?&#x201d; Oscar waved a handful of travel brochures under my nose. &#x201c;Hey, check these out. I think we should go to Barcelona first, maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oscar, I cannot discuss my honeymoon plans with you at the moment.&#x201d; My brain felt fuzzy. I sat up and glanced at my antique clock on the bedside table. Its hands glowed a mellow, comforting green that cut through the darkness. City lights sifted through my lace curtains, but even raucous Haight Street was hushed at three o&#x2019;clock in the morning.</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s the witching hour,&#x201d; Oscar whined.</p><p>&#x201c;Ideal for spellcasting, not for making travel plans.&#x201d;</p><p>Oscar cocked his head. &#x201c;What better time is there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the morning. After coffee. When normal people are awake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;re not &#x2018;normal people&#x2019;&#x2014;like we&#x2019;d even want to be, heh!&#x201d; He chuckled, a raspy sound reminiscent of a rusty saw.</p><p>I&#x2019;m Lily Ivory, a natural-born witch from West Texas who wandered the globe for years, searching for a safe place to settle down. On the advice of a parrot named Barnabas, whom I had met in a bar in Hong Kong, I had come to San Francisco&#x2014;specifically, to Haight Street&#x2014;where a witch like me could fit in.</p><p>I love it here. For the first time in my life I have friends, a community, a home.</p><p>If only the beautiful City by the Bay weren&#x2019;t so chock-full of murder and mayhem.</p><p>Oscar was right, I thought, plucking the soggy nightgown away from my skin. It was unusual to manifest during a dream, to bring a physical object&#x2014;in this case, water from the bay&#x2014;from the realm of slumber into the waking world.</p><p>I shivered again.</p><p>&#x201c;Just saying, we&#x2019;re both awake right now,&#x201d; Oscar continued. &#x201c;And not for nothing, but you might want to dry off and maybe put a towel down before you ruin your mattress.&#x201d;</p><p>Throwing back the covers, I hopped out of bed and headed to the bathroom to take a shower. Washing away the waters of the bay with lemon verbena soap, I lingered under the hot spray until warmth settled down deep in my core.</p><p>I emerged from the bathroom to find that Oscar had gone. He had left the travel brochures fanned out in a semicircle atop my comforter, and on the nightstand was a steaming mug of chamomile tea. He had also managed to dry the bed, somehow, and to make it up with fresh sheets.</p><p>Oscar might not be a typical (read: obedient) witch&#x2019;s familiar, but he definitely had his moments. Not to mention he had saved my life on more than one occasion.</p><p>I sat on the side of the bed, sipped the tea, and picked up a brochure with a glossy photo of Barcelona&#x2019;s famous Sagrada Fam�lia. The next brochure featured the Eiffel Tower, and the last the Voto Nacional de Quito, in Ecuador.</p><p>I had promised Oscar he could tag along on my honeymoon so that we could search for his mother, a creature suffering under a curse that transformed her into a gargoyle. The problem was he had no idea where she might be, only that &#x201c;gargoyles live a long time.&#x201d; I reminded myself to discuss this with my fianc�, Sailor, so that we could come up with a targeted approach before Oscar whipped up an entire world tour for us. Recently it had been difficult for Sailor and me to find the time&#x2014;and the peace of mind&#x2014;to talk about much of anything, much less gargoyle-guided tours.</p><p>I yawned. Speaking of honeymoons, I had a bucketload of decisions to make before the wedding, and more than a few wrinkles to iron out. My grandmother&#x2019;s eccentric coven had recently arrived in town; I was about to be married to a beautiful but secretive man&#x2014;an attachment to whom, I had been warned, might weaken my powers. Oscar kept disappearing to search for his mother even though he was supposed to be helping secure the perfect venue for my upcoming wedding, and recently I had come to realize that instead of one guiding spirit, I had two, and they weren&#x2019;t getting along, which was messing with my magic. And finally, my beloved adopted city of San Francisco was facing a frustratingly nonspecific existential threat that primarily involved a cupcake lady named Renee.</p><p>I took another sip of tea. I also still needed to find just the right vintage bridesmaid dresses for my friends Bronwyn and Maya. Under any other circumstance I would have said &#x201c;Wear what you like!&#x201d; but the style editor for the San Francisco Chronicle was planning to do a feature on our antique bridal wardrobe, which would be great publicity for my vintage clothing store, Aunt Cora&#x2019;s Closet.</p><p>I may be a witch and a soon-to-be bride, but I&#x2019;m also a small-business owner vying for customers on increasingly competitive Haight Street. I needed the exposure.</p><p>I also needed some rest.</p><p>Grabbing an in fidem venire praesidii amulet off the dresser mirror, I held it in my right hand and walked the perimeter of the bedroom in a clockwise direction, chanting:</p><p>I have done my day&#x2019;s work,</p><p>I am entitled to sweet sleep.</p><p>I am drawing a line on this carpet,</p><p>over which you cannot pass.</p><p>Powers of protection, powers who clear,</p><p>remove all those who don&#x2019;t belong here.</p><p>As I lay back down and switched off the light, waiting for sleep to take me, I couldn&#x2019;t shake the sensation of the waters closing over my head.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t like me to have a nightmare. Much less a manifesting nightmare.</p><p>It was enough to worry a weary witch like me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The next morning Aunt Cora&#x2019;s Closet was bursting at the seams with witches.</p><p>Fourteen elderly women&#x2014;an entire West Texas coven, plus my mother&#x2014;crowded the aisles of my shop, searching for glittery garments to rival the silver bugle bead jacket my grandmother Graciela had nabbed from my inventory a few days ago.</p><p>&#x201c;The sparklier, the better,&#x201d; said Agatha, pawing through a rack of &#x2019;80s-era, padded-shoulder flapper-revival tops.</p><p>&#x201c;I want one exactly like Graciela&#x2019;s, except in blue,&#x201d; said Kay, her thick tortoiseshell glasses magnifying her rheumy eyes to a comical extent as she tilted her head back to examine a royal blue sequined jacket through the bottom of her bifocals. Her beaded glasses chain clicked. &#x201c;Blue brings out my eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No two vintage items are the same, that&#x2019;s what makes them so special,&#x201d; MariaGracia said, then added in a loud whisper: &#x201c;If you want that silver one you can win it from Graciela on pagan poker night.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother, Maggie, was flipping listlessly through a rack of 1950s sundresses, listening to the goings-on with a slightly bewildered expression. Not only was my mother not part of the coven, she had only very recently come to approve of magic at all. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine what the long road trip from Texas had been like for her, given her boisterous, opinionated travel companions.</p><p>&#x201c;This one&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; said Winona, holding up a bolero jacket encrusted with gemlike rhinestones known as crystal chatons. Their facets reflected the late-morning light streaming in through the store&#x2019;s street-front display windows. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s purple, that&#x2019;s my color.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not purple, it&#x2019;s eggplant,&#x201d; said Caroline in an imperious tone, tucking her subtly highlighted blond hair behind one ear as she studied a full-length silk charmeuse evening gown.</p><p>&#x201c;Purple, eggplant, what&#x2019;s the difference?&#x201d; Winona shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;And that, my dear, is why you&#x2019;ve never mastered color magic,&#x201d; quipped Caroline.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, at least I can work with a pendulum without breaking a black mirror,&#x201d; muttered Winona, slipping some cheesy crackers to Oscar, who was currently in his public guise as my pet Vietnamese miniature potbellied pig.</p><p>The thirteen coven members were women of a certain age: Darlene, Winona, Betty, Caroline, Iris, Kay, MariaGracia, Nan, Pepper, Rosa, Viv, Agatha, and, of course, my grandmother Graciela. They represented all sizes and colors and temperaments; sort of a witchy United Nations drawn from the far-flung corners of our dusty West Texas county. I had grown up with and around these powerful, stubborn, quirky witches and was overjoyed to have them with me now.</p><p>I needed them with me now, given everything I was facing in San Francisco.</p><p>Even if they were helping themselves to some of my best sparkly inventory, for which I would not, of course, allow them to pay.</p><p>&#x201c;My mom&#x2014;Lucille&#x2014;can add a little bling to just about anything, if that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re after,&#x201d; offered Maya. &#x201c;Her shop&#x2019;s right next door; you could get things altered, or even custom-made. All the glitter you could ask for.&#x201d;</p><p>A chorus of &#x201c;oohs&#x201d; and &#x201c;aahs&#x201d; greeted this suggestion.</p><p>Graciela, secretly delighted that her discovery of the silver bugle bead jacket had caused such a sensation, was investigating a rack of gauzy negligees, muttering racy comments. She spoke in a spicy mixture of Spanish and English that I was unwilling to translate for my coworkers.</p><p>Bronwyn and Maya were helping to rehang items, but were mostly, with good-natured fascination, observing the chaos on the shop floor.</p><p>The coven had been hitting the touristy highlights when they stopped in for jackets to ward off the summer chill. Nan and Iris already had donned garish sweatshirts purchased from the ubiquitous street vendors that catered to the tourists who flocked to town, ready to enjoy all this city had to offer but ill-equipped for its microclimate. People often equated &#x201c;California&#x201d; with &#x201c;warm,&#x201d; only to discover that San Francisco had little in common with Los Angeles or San Diego. Here, a day might start out chilly and damp, soar to eighty degrees by lunchtime, then plummet into the fifties with the arrival of a thick blanket of afternoon fog. Locals learned to dress in layers.</p><p>I yawned. I&#x2019;m usually not bothered much by lack of sleep, but the memory of last night&#x2019;s dream troubled me. Could it have been a prophetic vision, or simply random snippets of worry and anxiety forming themselves into a story line? Or was someone&#x2014;or something&#x2014;harassing me by sending mares to disrupt my rest? I considered consulting the coven about it, but decided to wait for a more appropriate moment.</p><p>As I fiddled with the antique engagement ring on my finger and watched the druzy stone glitter under the shop lights, I hoped that whatever the nightmare signaled wouldn&#x2019;t interfere with my upcoming wedding.</p><p>Me. Betrothed. I still couldn&#x2019;t quite believe it.</p><p>At last, their hands clutching purple Aunt Cora&#x2019;s Closet bags filled with new-to-them clothes, the coven&#x2014;and my mother&#x2014;clambered back aboard the ancient yellow school bus to resume their tour of the city. Wendy, Bronwyn&#x2019;s coven sister and a San Francisco native, had offered to be their tour guide on the condition that she pilot the old bus. Impressed but concerned that Agatha had managed to drive them all the way from Texas, Wendy had suggested tactfully that, since San Francisco&#x2019;s famously steep hills were a bit of a challenge for even the most skilled chauffeur, it might be best for a local&#x2014;and, as Wendy pointed out quietly to me, someone with 20/20 vision&#x2014;to be behind the wheel.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you all tonight. I&#x2019;m bringing the pizza,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>The coven was staying with my friend Calypso Cafaro, a botanical expert with a big old farmhouse near Bolinas, up the coast. Since Calypso had filled her home with air beds and cots for a drawn-out witchy slumber party, the least I could do was to provide the occasional dinner. Calypso&#x2019;s farm was where the handfasting would be held in a mere two weeks, assuming Oscar was able to broker an agreement with the woods spirits. This could be tricky, because I had received their help once in the recent past but had neglected to properly repay the favor.</p><p>So there was that.</p><p>&#x201c;Make sure there&#x2019;s a vegetarian option?&#x201d; Viv said, hanging out one of the windows of the old school bus. She was watching her cholesterol, but was very fond of cheese.</p><p>&#x201c;Got it right here,&#x201d; I said, patting a pad of paper with thirteen special requests. The coven members were nothing if not opinionated. Some were vehemently anti-anchovy, others all-veggie, still others pro-pepperoni (&#x201c;A meat lover&#x2019;s version would be delightful!&#x201d;). I wondered if I should try to fit all their requests onto half a dozen pies or save myself time and trouble, and just order thirteen individual pizzas. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring some snacks as well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oooh, garlicky knots?&#x201d; someone called out; I couldn&#x2019;t tell who.</p><p>&#x201c;Garlicky knots.&#x201d; I nodded, jotting it down. &#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With dipping sauce!&#x201d; Rosa said.</p><p>&#x201c;Knots and dipping sauce. Got it.&#x201d;</p><p>Seeing where this conversation was going, Bronwyn intervened to bring it to an end. &#x201c;Now, won&#x2019;t that just be lovely! Have a wonderful tour, ladies. Tomorrow, I&#x2019;ll bring the makings for margaritas! Bye-bye!&#x201d;</p><p>Wendy closed the door, threw the bus in gear, and roared off in a cloud of diesel exhaust, carefully navigating the crowded streets of the Haight. Bronwyn and I waved until the bus disappeared, then turned to each other.</p><p>&#x201c;Phew!&#x201d; Bronwyn said.</p><p>&#x201c;You can say that again,&#x201d; I said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Phew!&#x201d;</p><p>Bronwyn was nothing if not obliging.</p><p>A lovely, ample, fifty-something Wiccan, Bronwyn had been enjoying the opportunity to discuss the healing properties of botanical teas and tonics with Graciela&#x2019;s coven&#x2014;not to mention grilling them about details of my misspent youth. Still, she and I had businesses to run. Bronwyn had special-order herbal infusions to mix, and I&#x2014;well, I...</p></p><h2>A Spy Among the Girls (Boy/Girl Battle)</h2><p>Valentine&#x2019;s Day is coming up and love is in the air between Beth Malloy and Josh Hatford. When they are spotted holding hands, Josh tells his teasing brothers that he&#x2019;s simply spying on the girls to see what they&#x2019;re plotting next. When Caroline Malloy decides she must know what it&#x2019;s like to fall in love, too, poor Wally Hatford is in for it! <br><br>Meanwhile, big sister Eddie couldn&#x2019;t care less about that mushy stuff. All she cares about is her sixth-grade science fair project. But when she comes up with a great plan, Josh and Jake Hatford horn in on her project. On the day the plan goes into action, little do the boys know that Eddie has a trick up her sleeve. And with daredevil Caroline&#x2019;s amazing attention-getting stunt, trouble is sure to follow. Get ready, the Malloys and Hatfords are at it again!</p><p>Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has written over 100 books, many of them taking place in West Virginia.One<br><br>Violins<br><br>Beth was in love, and it was positively sickening, Caroline thought.<br><br>Beth drew little hearts on the corners of her notebook, with the initials B plus J. She lingered at the end of the footbridge each morning on the way to school, hoping that the Hatford boys would be leaving about the same time and she could walk to school with Josh. Worst of all, Beth acted as though she'd rather be with Josh Hatford than with her own sisters.<br><br>Caroline, age nine, was the youngest of Coach Malloy's three daughters. Eddie, the oldest, couldn't be bothered. At eleven, all she wanted was, number one, to think up a really good experiment for the sixth-grade science fair, and number two, to make the Buckman Elementary baseball team when tryouts were held the following month. If Beth, a year younger, wanted to act like a lovesick idiot, that was her problem.<br><br>"But, Eddie, it ruins everything! We were having such a wonderful time annoying the guys! We weren't supposed to fall in love with them!" Caroline protested as they ate their cereal and watched the sun trying to rise in a gray February sky.<br><br>Fog cut the West Virginia hills around Buckman in half, hiding the tops completely. It covered sections of the valley as well. From the kitchen window, the girls could see the swinging footbridge over the Buckman River, but they couldn't see the Hatfords' house on the other side.<br><br>"What do you mean, 'we'? I haven't fallen in love with anyone," Eddie told her, shaking the last of the Cheerios into her bowl.<br><br>"Good!" said their father, who had coached the college football team the previous fall and helped it make the playoffs. Now he was teaching chemistry. "Because I won't know till summer whether I'm leaving Buckman or staying. And if we move back to Ohio, I don't want a bunch of weeping daughters crying over leaving their boyfriends."<br><br>"Ha!" said Eddie. "Not on your life!"<br><br>Beth entered the kitchen at that moment. She had pulled her blond hair up on either side of her head, fashioned the top into curls, and fastened it using a large comb with daisies.<br><br>"Oh, brother!" Eddie said when she saw her. "Who are you supposed to be? Miss America?"<br><br>"Eddie, don't make fun of your sister," Mrs. Malloy said sharply as she set a plate of toast on the table. "Beth spent a lot of time on her hair, and I think she looks lovely."<br><br>"All for Josh," Caroline remarked.<br><br>"Pardon me while I gag," said Eddie.<br><br>"For your information, I just wanted a new look," Beth said, avoiding their eyes and quickly reaching for the butter.<br><br>"Yeah, a new look in nail polish too," Caroline said, grabbing one of Beth's hands to look at her nails, which Beth had painted purple to match her sweater. Each nail had a little J painted on it with sparkling silver.<br><br>"That's enough!" said Mrs. Malloy. "Everyone's entitled to a little privacy. Caroline, finish your toast, please."<br><br>All because Beth and Josh were in that play together where they had to hold hands! Caroline thought later as she brushed her teeth. But she had to admit what was really bothering her. It wasn't that Beth liked Josh Hatford. Of the four Hatford brothers--Jake, Josh, Wally, and Peter--Josh was one of the nicest. It was the fact that by falling in love, Beth, not Caroline, was in the spotlight these days, and Caroline herself was used to being the center of attention.<br><br>If she were falling in love, she would make up a whole story to go with it. She would act out her own scenes, write her own love letters, and have secret meetings with her beloved down by the footbridge. Since she wanted to be a Broadway actress, she needed all the life experiences she could get, and falling in love was one of them. Beth's falling in love didn't count.<br><br>When it was time to leave for school, Caroline and Eddie left together because, these days, Beth always found excuses to lag behind. The Buckman River flowed into town on one side of Island Avenue, looped around the end, and came flowing back on the other side. A road bridge connected the end of Island Avenue to the business district, but a swinging footbridge on one side provided a shortcut for the girls to College Avenue and to Buckman Elementary.<br><br>This morning, as Caroline and Eddie were crossing the footbridge, looking down on the river's patches of ice heaped with snow like meringue on a pudding, they saw the Hatford boys already leaving their house, heading up the street toward school.<br><br>Eddie snickered. "Won't that put Beth in a snit," she said. "She purposely dawdled just so she could walk to school with Josh, and Josh started off early without her."<br><br>But Jake, Josh's twin, was first in line, plodding through the snow with seven-year-old Peter at his heels. Behind him came Wally, and Josh seemed to be hanging back. Every now and then he glanced over toward the Malloys' house, then quickly faced forward again.<br><br>In the next instant Beth's footsteps came tripping over the boards of the footbridge behind Caroline.<br><br>"Excuse me," Beth said, hurrying past, and caught up with Josh on the sidewalk, where he was pretending to tie his boot.<br><br>Caroline stopped walking and surveyed them from the bridge, hands on her hips.<br><br>"They aren't any good at all at falling in love," she declared. "When you fall in love, violins are supposed to play and bells are supposed to ring. A girl is supposed to rush across a bridge and into the arms of her boyfriend. She's not supposed to pretend she just happened to meet up with him, and he's not supposed to pretend he stopped to tie his boot."<br><br>"I wouldn't know," said Eddie. "And the last thing I want making noise around me is violins."<br><br>But following along behind Beth and Josh, seeing how the sleeves of their jackets hardly even touched, much less their hands, Caroline made a decision: if she was ever going to know what it felt like to fall in love, she'd have to do it herself--so if she was ever asked to play the part of a woman in love, she could do it from the heart.<br><br>She would simply have to choose a boy and fall in love with him, and since the only boy who sat close to her in school was Wally Hatford--who sat directly in front of her, in fact--Wally Hatford it would be.</p><h2>Dinosaur Empire! (Earth Before Us #1): Journey through the Mesozoic Era</h2><p>Ronnie is just a normal fifth-grader trying to pass her science class&#x2019;s impossible quiz on the history of dinosaurs . . . until she happens upon her neighbor&#x2014;Ms. Lernin&#x2014;a retired paleontologist. With the assistance of Science Magic, Ronnie and Ms. Lernin travel back through time and space to experience the Mesozoic Era firsthand. They visit three important time periods in the development of the Mesozoic Era: the Triassic, the Jurassic, and the Cretaceous. Along the way, Ronnie finds herself face-to-face with real-life dinosaurs and reptiles, like stegosauruses, velociraptors, and thalattosaurs. With the help of her neighbor&#x2019;s trusty knowledge of prehistoric times, she learns the differences between herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores, as well as between dinosaurs, insects, and reptiles. This insightful and informative graphic novel uses engaging art to bring facts to life, giving kids the tools to understand the evolution of these prehistoric creatures and the important effects this era had on our world today.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Abby Howard</b> is the creator of the comic website Junior Scientist Power Hour. Before becoming a full-time artist, Howard studied evolutionary biology at McGill University, where her deep interest in dinosaurs was born.<br> &nbsp;Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;An in-depth look at dinosaurs, geography, and evolution, presented through an appealing framing device. After Ronnie fails her dinosaur quiz, she travels back in time with her neighbor Miss Lernin, a paleontologist, for a firsthand lesson. The two visit four different time periods: the late Triassic, the late Jurassic, the "early-ish, almost middle Cretaceous," and the late Cretaceous. Miss Lernin educates Ronnie on the geography, climate, vegetation, and animal life of each era. Howard details characteristics of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures, covers similarities and differences among different species, and offers information on evolution, convergent evolution, and mutations. Names of species are in bold print and accompanied by a phonetic pronunciation. The simple, cartoon-style color illustrations are detailed enough to indicate differences among species. The conversation between Miss Lernin and Ronnie is fairly easy to follow, but the inclusion of a calendar between different eras to indicate the passing of time may be confusing, as each "day" represents millions of years. The last few pages include "Cool Animals from Other Times" and a drawing of a scientific family tree. VERDICT A great addition to graphic novel or dinosaur collections.&#x2014;Tamara Saarinen, Pierce County Library, WA</p><h2>Finding Common Ground: How to Communicate with those Outside the Christian Community...While We Still Can.</h2><p><p><i>"In more than twenty-five years of ministry and communicating, I have never heard a more concise, graphic, and articulate communicator.

At the center of it all is Judy Rhines, a fiercely independent soul, deeply lonely, who nonetheless builds a life for herself against all imaginable odds.<br> <br>Rendered in stunning, haunting detail, with Anita Diamant&#x2019;s keen ear for language and profound compassion for her characters, <i>The Last Days of Dogtown</i> is an extraordinary retelling of a long-forgotten chapter of early American life.</p><p>Anita Diamant is the bestselling author of the novels <i>The Boston Girl</i>, <i>The Red Tent, Good Harbor,</i> <i>The Last Days of Dogtown</i>, and <i>Day After Night</i>, and the collection of essays, <i>Pitching My Tent.</i> An award-winning journalist whose work appeared in <i>The Boston Globe Magazine</i> and <i>Parenting,</i> she is the author of six nonfiction guides to contemporary Jewish life. She lives in Massachusetts. Visit her website at AnitaDiamant.com.Anita Diamant's stark sketch of a group of society's throwaways focuses on the once promising community of Dogtown, near Gloucester, Mass. By 1814, the area is reduced to broken-down hovels populated by wild dogs, whores, emancipated slaves, destitute widows and orphans, who survive by wile, duplicity, and sheer force of will. Kate Nelligan's performance highlights these examples of human resilience, from Black Ruth, an African woman who dresses like a man; to Tammy, a vicious old woman who torments her orphaned nephew; to Judy, whose taboo love affair with Cornelius, a freed slave, is fraught with danger. With unsentimental eloquence, Nelligan embodies the free-thinking spirit of these New Englanders and handles individual joys and tragedies with compassion. A fascinating book and an extraordinary performance. S.J.H.

It gets the majority of attention, the stories of its schools and movements and masterpieces the stuff of pop culture legend. Chicago, on the other hand . . . well, people here just get on with the work of making art.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now that art is getting its due. <i>Art in Chicago</i> is a magisterial account of the long history of Chicago art, from the rupture of the Great Fire in 1871 to the present, Manierre Dawson, L�szl� Moholy-Nagy, and Ivan Albright to Chris Ware, Anne Wilson, and Theaster Gates. The first single-volume history of art and artists in Chicago, the book&#x2014;in recognition of the complexity of the story it tells&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t follow a single continuous trajectory. Rather, it presents an overlapping sequence of interrelated narratives that together tell a full and nuanced, yet wholly accessible history of visual art in the city. From the temptingly blank canvas left by the Fire, we loop back to the 1830s and on up through the 1860s, tracing the beginnings of the city&#x2019;s institutional and professional art world and community. From there, we travel in chronological order through the decades to the present. Familiar developments&#x2014;such as the founding of the Art Institute, the Armory Show, and the arrival of the Bauhaus&#x2014;are given a fresh look, while less well-known aspects of the story, like the contributions of African American artists dating back to the 1860s or the long history of activist art, finally get suitable recognition. The six chapters, each written by an expert in the period, brilliantly mix narrative and image, weaving in oral histories from artists and critics reflecting on their work in the city, and setting new movements and key works in historical context. The final chapter, comprised of interviews and conversations with contemporary artists, brings the story up to the present, offering a look at the vibrant art being created in the city now and addressing ongoing debates about what it means to identify as&#x2014;or resist identifying as&#x2014;a Chicago artist today. The result is an unprecedentedly inclusive and rich tapestry, one that reveals Chicago art in all its variety and vigor&#x2014;and one that will surprise and enlighten even the most dedicated fan of the city&#x2019;s artistic heritage.<br> &nbsp;<br> Part of the Terra Foundation for American Art&#x2019;s year-long Art Design Chicago initiative, which will bring major arts events to venues throughout Chicago in 2018, <i>Art in Chicago</i> is a landmark publication, a book that will be the standard account of Chicago art for decades to come. No art fan&#x2014;regardless of their city&#x2014;will want to miss it.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Maggie Taft</b> is an art historian and the founding director of the Haddon Avenue Writing Institute, a community-based writing center for teenage girls. <b>Robert Cozzolino</b> is the Patrick and Aimee Butler Curator of Paintings at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. He has curated more than thirty exhibitions, ranging from <i>World War I and American Art </i>to surveys of Peter Blume, David Lynch, Elizabeth Osborne, and George Tooker."The most comprehensive treatment of the topic to date. . . . The book conspicuously lacks timelines and keywords, avoiding the encyclopaedic approach of past efforts. At the heart of this new history is instead a compelling story about how artistic identity is formed in the shadows. . . . All of these topics are deeply covered in the book's excellent essays." (<i>Art Newspaper</i>)<br><br>"The book makes a persuasive proposal that Chicago, as a metropolitan art center, was and still is ahead of the curve. . . . The contributing authors and editors of <i>Art in Chicago </i>do not merely chronicle the recent progress and issues that arise around this unique but fickle economy; they also present tangible dialogue between artists, writers, and curators in an extensive series of interviews that comprise the latter half of this book. I have barely been able to touch on the wealth of knowledge and history this comprehensive text has to offer, let alone the cultural ambitions that can be garnered from the discussions in it. . . . It is a resource and reference that feels essential not only to anyone who is interested in art but also to anyone who is interested in urban life and culture, as well as politics and history."

He is also Australia&#39;s number one children&#39;s author! His books, including his popular Treehouse series, have been hugely successful internationally, winning awards and becoming bestsellers in the UK and the USA as well as in his homeland, Australia. The fourth Treehouse book, The 52-Storey Treehouse, won the Australian Book Industry Awards Book of the Year prize, the first children&#39;s book to ever do so. Andy thrives on having an audience: he has worked as a high-school teacher, been the lead singer in a rock band and a stand-up comedian. He is a passionate advocate for literacy, has two daughters and lives in Melbourne, Australia. Terry Denton is Andy&#39;s best mate. He is also a bestselling and award-winning writer and illustrator based in Melbourne, Australia. Among other things, he worked on the Horrible Science series for Scholastic UK. He lives by the beach with his wife and three kids. The 13-Storey Treehouse won the Sainsburys Children&#39;s Book Award in 2015, the Lancashire Fantastic Book Award in 2016, as well as the 2016 Coventry Inspiration Award.This book is about a gigantic treehouse with two boys named Andy and Terry. They write stories together. Andy writes and Terry draws the pictures. When I say 'gigantic treehouse', I mean a treehouse that has thousands of rooms It has a giant catapult, a games room, a kitchen, two bedrooms, a man-eating shark tank (yikes!), a bowling alley, a see-through swimming pool and many more. Andy and Terry actually LIVE in the treehouse. I would really love to live in a treehouse like that - who wouldn't? I thought this book was hilarious, surprising (like when a mermaid suddenly turned into a sea monster and tried to eat the boys!) and very interesting. I read this book easily without any help and my mum has already ordered The 26-Storey Treehouse! * Toppsta Reviewer * My daughter and i loved this book - a fulfilled adventure about two writers trying to find inspiration for their next book. The story follows them through all the mishaps on the way!! Full of fantastic, crazy illustrations throughout. * Toppsta Reviewer * Read to my Year 3 class (30 children, ages 7-8) who all love Diaries of a Wimpy Kid and Tom Gates. (This book initially reminded me of these due to the mixture of text and drawings) They really enjoyed the quirky storyline and bizarre sense of humour running throughout. Two said it reminded them of 'You're a Bad Man, Mr Gum ('The Truth is a lemon meringue!). The children particularly enjoyed how the illustrations and text were given equal importance and it has already inspired some to start their own journals chronicling their daily life in more detail. The rest of the series was in our book corner for no more than a few minutes before being signed out to be shared with reading buddies, friends and family. Three turned up with their own copy of this book the following week! Another highlight: a Mum who had earlier despaired of finding a book that her son would love wrote in to thank me for sending the first book home as her son has now devoured the first three books! Disclaimer: We won the first four books in the series in a giveaway by Lovereading4kids and Macmillan Kids. This in now way affects the tough judgement that all thirty children have passed on this book. * Toppsta Reviewer * This is silly and fun and a great book to encourage of love of reading in young children. I read this to my 5 year old daughter and months later she still makes reference to a scene in the book. She is a strong reader for her age and wanted to get the other books in the series. She started reading more bits of them herself before devouring the 65 and 78-storey treehouse books entirely by herself. The 78-Storey Treehouse she read in one sitting. She can't wait for the 91-Storey Treehouse to come out later this year. * Toppsta Reviewer * I bought the set of these after reading the other Toppsta reviews. My son read this book solidly in one day. He has LOVED it, the mix of text and illustrations is ideal for this age range, I could hear him laughing away to himself whilst he was reading it, although I'm not convinced he followed the whole story, he has since read most of it again (as we were out and the next one was at home) A fabulous buy that will be read time and time again. * Toppsta Reviewer * Brilliant series and if you haven't read them yet why not? Start at the beginning and work through them all. Laugh out loud funny and I love reading about all the things they have in their treehouse. * Toppsta Reviewer * I liked this book as it was funny, adventures and most importantly troublesome.Andy and Terry were hilariously brilliant. * Toppsta Reviewer * I bought this book (the first in a series) on the basis of many positive reviews. Having now read it, I know my decision is vindicated. It's funny, hugely imaginative and has LOTS of pictures. What child would not want a treehouse with see-through swimming pool, lemonade fountain, games room, bowling alley and marshmallow machine? Besides, this one is also home to book-making duo Andy, the writer, and Terry, the illustrator. But story-making isn't always straightforward, especially when there are gorillas to contend with. No matter, flying cats to the rescue! And when the story is over, there are still jokes, a spot-the-difference, a maze, wordsearch and treehouse triva to enjoy. Children with the latest brain-to-brain-information technology will be able to read it; others will have to ask for it at the library or a bookshop. They will also want to visit http://www.andygriffiths.com.au/ for loads more fun and the latest from author Andy Griffiths. * Toppsta Reviewer * My son: I like this book because of the funny pictures. One of my favourite ones was of a man on the toilet flying using balloons. It is funny how Terry will do anything not to write their book. I think it is a great book. Mum: My son has been reading this aloud to me. Whilst there are over two hundred pages to this book, a lot of it is taken up with humorous black and white illustrations. It is quite a wacky sort of book, with an off beat sense of humour (sea monsters disguised as mermaids, catnaries (cross between a cat and a canary), self portrait of finger labelled with moose, finger prince, singing flea.... etc.) which definitely appeals to my seven year old. We bought this as part of a set from Book People. So thankfully it has been a hit so far. * Toppsta Reviewer * Having read The 78-Storey Treehouse and lived it we requested this from the library. My son loves these books and studies the illustrations which adorn every page. He finds the stories very funny and likes that it has the same characters (the author and illustrator!!) Definitely recommend this book - and we are now moving on to another in the series from the library! * Toppsta Reviewer * My son absolutely adores this whole series of books. They are hilariously funny but so imaginative and creative. I've recommended them to so many people and haven't yet found a child who doesn't love them. This first book sets the scene with Andy and Terry - the characters and authors/illustrators - living in a treehouse with 13 stories who are meant to be writing a book but keep getting distracted by an endless stream of hilarious madness. * Toppsta Reviewer * I thought that this book was funny because of the flying cats. This book had lots of animals in it. * Toppsta Reviewer * This book is about friends Andy and a Terry that live in a really cool 13-storey treehouse, with cool things like a bowling alley, games room and secret lab. They invent things and write things; Andy does the writing and Terry does the pictures. I could read this book on my own without assistance. I read it pretty quickly as it was really interesting and funny, so I wanted to keep reading it. I liked there was chapters, so I could read to the end of the chapter and knew where I was picking up, and each chapter was a good length. I liked at the end of the book there were fun things to do; a word search, maze, spot the difference, a quiz and jokes. The black and white illustrations helped bring the book to life. Chapter 7 the monster mermaid, maybe be scary to some readers. The pictures of the monster aren't really scary, but what is written might scare some; talks about eating people, but goes into detail; ripping limbs, crushing heads etc, so a bit gruesome. One chapter has one word all the way through, which was silly but funny. The friends get up to some crazy things, an enjoyable book. * Toppsta Reviewer * My son loved the cartoon images, the great imagination and has since brought the next book in the series. * Toppsta Reviewer * Packed with cartoons and craziness * Sunday Express * Especially good for reluctant readers as it is heavily illustrated and VERY funny . . . This really is the coolest treehouse ever! * Angels &amp; Urchins * Full of crazy, funny pictures, which will make you laugh . . . Extremely enjoyable, very funny and easy to read! -- SophieStarlight * Guardian.com * Longtime collaborators Griffiths and Denton (Killer Koalas from Outer Space) get metafictional in their latest book (first published in Australia), and the result is anarchic absurdity at its best... Denton's manic cartooning captures every twist and turn in hilarious detail, as babies are pelted with garbage, yapping dogs squashed, and monkeys catapulted into the distance. A sequel was published last year in Australia and can't arrive soon enough. -- Publishers Weekly * Publishers Weekly * With its slapstick humour, brilliant absurdities and some bonus puzzles to solve at the back of the book, The 13-Storey Treehouse is the best 'tall story' you'll read this year! * Lancashire Evening Post *</p><h2>Ormus Modern Day Alchemy: Primer of Ormus Collection Processes Reference Edition</h2><p>Timeless information......never out of date, Ormus: Modern Day Alchemy is one book that no modern health care library should be without.

EMMONS graduated from Pharmacy school in 1976 and owned a Pharmacy in Pontiac, Michigan until 1991 when she moved to South Florida. She observed alternative healing modalities in action as a close friend underwent a serious health crisis and this experience sparked an interest in the subject that led to knowledge of the Ormus material and its beneficial effects. Having a pharmacy background, she desired to know how to collect Ormus from fresh water seawater,organic matter, minerals and metals. Beginning in 2004 devoted herself to finding and learning from those who could teach and explain proper technique. These included Ormus Researchers and a well-known commercial Alchemist. A friend, having heard about the culmination of these efforts, verbalized how the Ormus community-both current and future-could benefit by having a manual of Ormus collection processes and that Chris embodied professional training and personal traits to complete such a work. Because Chris never forgot how it feels to yearn for the knowledge of Ormus collection processes she began work on such a manual. It is now available to the Ormus community and the world.

Climate changes are cyclical and are driven by the Earth's position in the galaxy, the sun, wobbles in the Earth's orbit, ocean currents, and plate tectonics. In previous times, atmospheric carbon dioxide was far higher than at present but did not drive climate change. No runaway greenhouse effect or acid oceans occurred during times of excessively high carbon dioxide. During past glaciations, carbon dioxide was higher than it is today.

For two years, she described life in hiding in vivid, unforgettable detail and grappled with the unfolding events of World War II. Before the attic was raided in August, 1944, Anne Frank furiously revised and edited her work, crafting a piece of literature that she hoped would be read by the public after the war. And read it has been.</p><p>In <em>Anne Frank</em>, bestselling author Francine Prose deftly parses the artistry, ambition, and enduring influence of Anne Frank&#x2019;s beloved classic, <em>The Diary of a Young Girl</em>. She investigates the diary&#x2019;s unique afterlife: the obstacles and criticism Otto Frank faced in publishing his daughter&#x2019;s words; the controversy surrounding the diary&#x2019;s Broadway and film adaptations, and the social mores of the 1950s that reduced it to a tale of adolescent angst and love; the conspiracy theories that have cried fraud, and the scientific analysis that proved them wrong. Finally, having assigned the book to her own students, Prose considers the rewards and challenges of teaching one of the world&#x2019;s most read, and banned, books. How has the life and death of one girl become emblematic of the lives and deaths of so many, and why do her words continue to inspire?</p><p>Approved by both the Anne Frank House Foundation in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank-Fonds in Basel, run by the Frank family, <em>Anne Frank</em> unravels the fascinating story of a memoir that has become one of the most compelling, intimate, and important documents of modern history.</p></p><p><p>In June 1942, Anne Frank received a red-and-white-checked diary for her thirteenth birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in an Amsterdam attic to escape the Nazis. For two years, with ever-increasing maturity, Anne crafted a memoir that has become one of the most compelling documents of modern history. But Anne Frank's diary, argues Francine Prose, is as much a work of art as it is a historical record. Through close reading, she marvels at the teenage Frank's skillfully natural narrative voice, at her finely tuned dialogue and ability to turn living people into characters.</p><p><em>Anne Frank: The Book, The Life, The Afterlife</em> tells the extraordinary story of the book that became a force in the world. Along the way, Prose definitively establishes that Anne Frank was not an accidental author or a casual teenage chronicler but a writer of prodigious talent and ambition. </p><p>Francine Prose is the author of twenty-one works of fiction, including <em>Mister Monkey</em>; the <em>New York Times </em>bestseller <em>Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932</em>; <em>A Changed Man</em>, which won the Dayton Literary Peace Prize; and <em>Blue Angel</em>, a finalist for the National Book Award. Her works of nonfiction include <em>Anne Frank: The Book, The Life, The Afterlife</em>, and the<em> New York Times </em>bestseller <em>Reading Like a Writer</em>. The recipient of numerous grants and honors, including a Guggenheim, a Fulbright, and a Director&#x2019;s Fellow at the Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library, she is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

It just feels that way.<br> </b><br> Certified nutritionist Leanne Ely loves delicious food and is dedicated to enticing today&#x2019;s busy families back to the dinner table with home cooking that cannot be beat. In <i>Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way</i>, she integrates low-carb requirements into her m�lange of dining pleasures for every season&#x2013;providing easy-to-follow menus and highlighting per-serving measurements of calories, fat, protein, carbohydrates, cholesterol, and sodium for each dish.<br><br> Itemizing ingredients by product in convenient lists, Ely makes your grocery shopping quick and effortless. She also gives you a helping hand in the kitchen with shortcuts that take the stress out of cooking, and suggests menu variations for children and family members who choose not to go the low-carb route.<br><br> The result? These dinners are not only balanced and healthy but truly varied and delectably good to eat. Main dishes like Low-Carb Beef Stroganoff, Crustless Quiche Lorraine, Crock-Pot Pork Jambalaya, Skillet Salmon with Horseradish Cream, and nearly 150 other entrees (plus recommendations for great side dishes) make dinnertime special in more ways than one.</p><p>LEANNE ELY is considered the expert on family cooking and healthy eating. Between her popular Heart of a Woman radio show in Southern California and her weekly &#x201c;Food for Thought&#x201d; column at the ever-popular Flylady.net website, thousands of fans have already discovered Leanne Ely&#x2019;s secrets to easily prepared, well-balanced meals.INTRODUCTION<br><br>Every time I turn around, it seems something new has appeared, making fabulous low-carb claims, whether it is a book, product, spokes- person, or what have you. The never-ending hit parade of all things low carb doesn&#x2019;t seem to be coming to an end anytime soon. As a matter of fact, the business of low carb is escalating faster than the national deficit&#x2014;not quite in the trillions of dollars, but definitely billions. For a long time I thought this was just a Dr. Stillman d�j�-vu deal, until the flashback wouldn&#x2019;t go away.<br><br>As the Dinner Diva of SavingDinner.com, I want to know what my subscribers want. A while back, I began getting hit with a ton of requests for a more low-carb-friendly Menu-Mailer. The last straw came when one of my subscribers who had been with me from the beginning e-mailed me and told me that her husband had been diagnosed with diabetes. And yes, she asked the fatal question: Would I please do a more low-carb-friendly Menu-Mailer?<br><br>Like a lot of people, I believed the low-carb fad diets would hit the skids anytime soon, and I couldn&#x2019;t wait. I pooh-poohed the idea and scoffed at the notion of those limiting their carbs. In my mind, eating low carb was eating bacon, eggs, and steaks. You call that healthy?<br><br>I did a little research and discovered going low carb didn&#x2019;t need to look like steak for every meal. Quite the contrary&#x2014;it could be a lifestyle of variety and flavor, could actually contain vegetables, and be outright healthy. In the meantime, I tried going low carb myself. Not only did I feel better and more satiated, while eating less food, but I began to read and read some more on the actual, real-life, not-manufactured-for-your-viewing-pleasure science. There really is something behind this low-carb phenomenon. It is here to stay, and I&#x2019;m very glad it is. I guess you could say that I&#x2019;m a believer.<br><br>In August 2003, I realized this was something exciting and introduced my first Low-Carb Menu-Mailer (for more information on Menu-Mailer, go to www.savingdinner.com). I realize now, more than a year later, that low carb isn&#x2019;t a diet; it&#x2019;s a lifestyle and it is here to stay.<br><br>It is in that spirit that I offer you the next Saving Dinner book. While the recipes are low carb (and that is 10 or fewer net grams of carbs for the entr�e&#x2014;not counting the Serving Suggestions), there are certain members of your household who aren&#x2019;t going to want to do low carb all the way, so there are regular, non-low-carb Serving Suggestions offered as well for that person or persons. You don&#x2019;t have to make two dinners so you can low carb it, while the kids eat a regular, non-low-carb meal. Isn&#x2019;t that great?<br><br>Just as the first Saving Dinner book offered you the recipes, menus, and shopping lists divvied up by weeks and seasons, so does this book. I think this is the way to go in today&#x2019;s world&#x2014;having the hard work of menu planning already done and ready to go. The shopping lists are again at your convenience, on my website in a printer-friendly format, just go to www.savingdinner.com and click on Shopping Lists. You don&#x2019;t need to schlep your book to the grocery store and take a chance on losing it.<br><br>A big caveat to those who may be following certain low-carb diets with big lists of do&#x2019;s and don&#x2019;ts. This book does not adhere to any one low-carb diet plan. It&#x2019;s just low carb, end of story. You won&#x2019;t find oddball ingredients like pork rinds, weird ketosis-inducing, low-carb mixes made with strange things you&#x2019;ve never heard of. I use regular ingredients and admittedly, I&#x2019;ve been skewered for it. People have written absolutely unprintable e-mails denouncing my low-carb ideas because I had the audacity to add 1 tablespoon of whole-wheat flour to a recipe&#x2014;even though I&#x2019;ve kept the recipe very low carb. Apparently, in their eyes I&#x2019;ve committed the carbinal sin (get it?) by using big no-no ingredients.<br><br>But the issue in my mind, is keeping the recipes low carb (they are) and using real ingredients, easily accessible and found at just about any market, to carry out this goal. I&#x2019;ve held true to this principle for years: that the more natural and real your ingredients are, the easier it is to accomplish and keep up as a lifestyle.<br><br>Consider this book as another weapon in your arsenal to keep you organized and on target to help you get dinner on the table. With this tool, you can accomplish that without having to sacrifice your time, health objectives, or sanity. Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way is all about helping you meet your goals.<br><br>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br><br>Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way is designed to give you everything you need to do dinner. The recipes, serving suggestions, and, most important, categorized shopping lists are all contained within this book. Speaking of shopping lists, for your convenience, I have also added printer-friendly shopping lists to my website (savingdinner.com) so you can print out the appropriate list without having to lug your book to the store.<br><br>There are two types of Serving Suggestions in the book: LC (low carb) and just Serving Suggestions (regular ones for non-low- carbing family members). The Serving Suggestions are asterisked on the grocery lists because I don&#x2019;t want you to feel roped in by any of my suggestions. However, the LC Serving Suggestions are not asterisked, as I am trying to help you put together a complete, low-carb meal.<br><br>I would strongly suggest that you read the recipes before you hit the grocery store each week with the list. It helps to know what your menu is about before you head out the door. That five minutes of reading through the menu and recipes may help you make a quick decision if your store is out of something or if you would prefer a substitute. You can&#x2019;t do that if you don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re shopping for!<br><br>This book is chock full of sidebars . . . read them! There is a ton of information to help you take full advantage of these menus and to make the recipes your own. As I was writing these recipes out, I would think of something else that would empower you in the kitchen, so I made a sidebar out of it. The more you know, the faster you&#x2019;re able to do the recipes and shopping. That&#x2019;s a good thing!<br><br>When appropriate, I have added Do-Ahead Tips to help make dinner easier the next day (e.g., precooking turkey or chicken for a salad, etc.). However, there are all kinds of things you can do the day before, if you so desire. I kept it basic, you might want to do more&#x2014;it&#x2019;s totally up to you. You also can move days around if you want&#x2014;just remember that the Do-Ahead Tips may no longer be appropriate if you do.<br><br>If you do want to make substitutions (due to allergies, preferences, etc.) on some of the grocery items, feel free! For those who are more kosher minded, the pork and shellfish recipes can easily be substituted out with any poultry, chicken being a very easy fit.<br><br>Just remember, Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way is another weapon in your arsenal to help you conquer the drive-thru and keep your family at the dinner table.

Sardonic yet vulnerable, Jane toils, unappreciated, in her strict uncle&#x2019;s grocery store and politely observes the traditional principle of <i>nunchi</i> (a combination of good manners, hierarchy, and obligation).

Northern Boulevard was our main commercial thoroughfare, and two-family attached houses crowded its side streets. They say the neighborhood once contained a hearty swath of the American population, but when I landed here as an infant, Flushing was starting to give way to the Koreans. By the time I graduated from college in 2000, Northern looked like this: Daedong River Fish Market, named after the East River of Pyongyang. Chosun Dynasty Auto Body, run by the father of a girl from my BC calc class. Kumgang Mountain Dry Cleaning, owned by my uncle&#x2019;s accountant&#x2019;s cousin on his mother&#x2019;s side. This was my America: all Korean, all the time.</p><p>Flushing. The irony was that none of its residents could pronounce the name of their adopted hometown; the Korean language lacked certain English consonants and clusters. The letter <i>F</i> was assimilated to an <i>H</i> or a <i>P.</i> The adults at church would go <i>Hoo </i>before they could form the word, as if cooling it off their tongue. My uncle and aunt&#x2019;s rendition: Poo, Rushing. It could&#x2019;ve been poetry.</p><p>Home was 718 Gates Street, Unit 1. It was my Uncle Sang&#x2019;s house, and I lived there with his family: his wife, Hannah, and my younger cousins, Mary and George. A few blocks away was his store. It was a modest-size grocery carrying a mix of American and Korean products, along with the usual emergency supplies&#x2014;flashlights and batteries, candles and condoms. From Northern you could spot our green awning, bearing four white letters in all caps: F-O-O-D. Below it were large wooden tables stacked with pyramids of fruit.</p><p>One day in late summer, I was crouched in one of the aisles, turning cans of beans face out and flush with the lip of the shelf. I heard someone say, in Korean, <i>&#x201c;Jane-ah. I heard about Lowood. What a shame.&#x201d;</i></p><p>It was Mrs. Bae, the wife of the pastor of our church. I stood and ducked my head into a bow. At five foot seven, I towered over most of the women of Flushing. Her words were like salt sprinkled on the sting of being the only one in my graduating class still bagging groceries and restocking merchandise. The economy&#x2014;with the exception of the tech industry&#x2014;was, for the most part, still booming. I&#x2019;d had a job with Lowood Capital Partners lined up since my senior year last fall, never anticipating that in the months that followed, here&#x2019;s what would happen: The company would be heavily leveraged in dot-com investments, the CEO would resign after accusations of insider trading, and the interim CEO would issue a hiring freeze. My job offer had been rescinded.</p><p>Mrs. Bae went on. About how her daughter Jessica worked such long hours at Bear Stearns yet still she would wash the rice and do the laundry and help her little sister with her homework after she got home. How Mrs. Bae felt undeserving of such a devoted daughter. What Mrs. Bae didn&#x2019;t know was that &#x201c;Jessica the PK&#x201d; (Pastor&#x2019;s Kid) had cut class every Thursday our senior year of high school to shoot pool at Amsterdam Billiards in the city.</p><p><i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell our Jessica to help you,&#x201d;</i> Mrs. Bae said, staring back with the usual curious expression she seemed to reserve for me. You&#x2019;d think that after all these years I would&#x2019;ve gotten used to it. I didn&#x2019;t. I averted my eyes, focusing on the hairline cracks running through the floor tiles.</p><p><i>&#x201c;No, no, that&#x2019;s too much trouble for you.&#x201d; </i>That was Sang, approaching us.</p><p>They had the usual exchange&#x2014;&#x201c;<i>No, no trouble at all, you and Mary&#x2019;s mother must be so worried.&#x201d; &#x201c;Eh, what can you do?&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;before my uncle turned his head sharply, shooting me a look. I thanked Mrs. Bae. He shot me another look&#x2014;that was my cue to go get her some fruit, on the house. And none of the cheap stuff.</p><p>That was the power of <i>nunchi. </i>There&#x2019;s no word for it in English; perhaps its closest literal translation is &#x201c;eye sense.&#x201d; My friend Eunice Oh sometimes likened <i>nunchi</i> to the Eye of Sauron: an all-knowing stink eye that monitored your every social misstep. Other times she said it was like the Force, a way of bending the world to your will. But Eunice had an annoying tendency of bringing everything back to <i>Star Wars </i>or <i>Star Trek,</i> Tolkien or Philip K. Dick. For me <i>nunchi </i>was less about some sci-fi power and more about common sense. It was the ability to read a situation and anticipate how you were expected to behave. It<i> </i>was filling your elder&#x2019;s water glass first, before reaching for your own. The adults at church always said that good <i>nunchi</i> was the result of a good &#x201c;family education.&#x201d;</p><p>On my way to the fruit stalls, I was intercepted by Mrs. O&#x2019;Gall, a petite Irish granny who frequented Food every day. Cradling a head of iceberg lettuce, she demanded help with the Hellmann&#x2019;s mayonnaise: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too damn high.&#x201d;</p><p>The jars on the shelf were at hip level&#x2014;I handed one to her. Mrs. O&#x2019;Gall shook her head. &#x201c;No, gimme the smaller one.&#x201d; When I told her that eight-ounce jars were the smallest we carried, she said, &#x201c;Unbelievable. You people.&#x201d; She told me to put in a special order from our distributor.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Mrs. O&#x2019;Gall. I&#x2019;m sorry, Mrs. O&#x2019;Gall.&#x201d;</p><p>She walked away with her iceberg and mayo, leaving a trail of her particular scent in her wake. Mrs. O&#x2019;Gall had that unwashed smell the elderly sometimes had, one that made you think of brown paper bags left out in the rain and chin whiskers and absentee adult children. It was the smell of abandonment.</p><p>I returned to Mrs. Bae with the fruit, but she was gone. I was making my way back to the shelf of beans when another customer stopped me. Then I rushed to man the second cash register&#x2014;a line of new customers had formed. The delivery guy from the beverage distributor cut to the front, waving a pink invoice at me. &#x201c;Who checked your cases?&#x201d; I demanded. &#x201c;The little guy,&#x201d; he said. I knew he was referring to our stock boy, Hwan. I jerked my head, motioning him to the back of the line&#x2014;we were <i>his </i>customers, so he could very well wait&#x2014;and when I reached him, I paid him with the dirty twenties we kept at the bottom of the cash drawer, the crisper bills reserved for the shoppers.</p><p>I was just about to leave the register when Mrs. O&#x2019;Gall returned; I processed her mayonnaise refund, even though she&#x2019;d opened the jar and removed one teaspoon. Then it was over to the wooden stalls, to pick out the bruised and dented fruits from their unblemished counterparts.</p><p>I was making my way back to the bean cans again when I saw Sang. His was a harried gait, and it always struck me as less a rush <i>to </i>his destination than a hasty departure <i>from</i>&#x2014;like he couldn&#x2019;t get out of a place fast enough.</p><p>He frowned when he arrived at where I stood. &#x201c;You do this?&#x201d; he said, handing me a pink invoice&#x2014;the soda delivery I&#x2019;d just signed off on. My uncle usually spoke to me in English, even though it was his weaker language.</p><p>I could hardly expect him to clarify. Sang had a very specific organizational system for running Food; he knew that store and its many intricacies like the back of his chapped hands. The problem was, that knowledge was all in his head and none of us had access to it. And he expected you to read his mind.</p><p>Sang had other rules, too, that I&#x2019;d had to learn over the years:</p><p>No chew gum.</p><p>No back-talk to customer.</p><p>No act like you so special.</p><p>No ask stupid question.</p><p>&#x201c;Go to office get last week invoice,&#x201d; he ordered. I rushed past the aisles of produce and dairy cases to the back corner of the store. This was our &#x201c;office&#x201d;&#x2014;cardboard boxes flattened into walls and duct-taped to leftover PVC pipes. The desk was a slab of scrap wood suspended by L-brackets drilled into the concrete wall. The chair was an upended milk crate. As I rummaged through the banana box on the floor&#x2014;our version of an accounts-payable/accounts-receivable department&#x2014;I thought of my interview at Lowood on the 103rd floor of the World Trade Center. My cubicle would have had walls of sleek frosted glass, overlooking an office that overlooked the river.</p><p>I found the soda invoice. In my haste to get back to Sang, I tripped on the cinder block propped against the door of the walk-in refrigerator box. I would have pitched forward if Hwan hadn&#x2019;t dropped his hand truck and rushed to break my fall.</p><p>&#x201c;You okay, Miss Jane?&#x201d; he said, steadying me to my feet.</p><p>&#x201c;That stupid door,&#x201d; was all I managed, my cheeks flushed with embarrassment. The problem with the walk-in was that unless you knew how to jiggle the handle a certain way, the door failed to latch. The refrigerator kept things cold as it was, but if it was sealed properly, its contents would stay preserved for up to three days, even if the power blew out. The door, as it stood, was a liability. But whenever I brought the subject up to Sang, he&#x2019;d wave my words away. <i>If not broke, why you gotta fix? </i>For Sang the inverse was also true: Everything broken could be jerry-rigged to working order. It was his own special form of madness&#x2014;he never stopped trying to salvage the unsalvageable.</p><p>&#x201c;Why you take so long?&#x201d; Sang said when I returned with the invoice. He jabbed a finger at the offending signature. <i>My </i>signature. Apparently we were supposed to receive credit for two more soda cases, but the new invoice didn&#x2019;t reflect that credit. I realized, with sinking stupidity, that I should have called for my uncle on the spot, instead of taking the deliveryman&#x2019;s word as a given. Things like this happened every now and again&#x2014;the delivery guys would do a bait and switch, &#x201c;pocketing&#x201d; the extra pallet or two&#x2014;but the store had been busy. I knew what Sang would have said if I&#x2019;d paged him over the loudspeaker<i>&#x2014;Why you ask stupid question? Where your </i>nunchi<i>?</i>&#x2014;as though it were something I&#x2019;d carelessly misplaced somewhere, like a set of keys or a receipt.</p><p>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you just tell me about the credit?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Then I would&#x2019;ve known&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk back to your uncle,&#x201d; </i>my aunt interrupted, walking toward us. Then, to her husband, <i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Mr. Hwang, from Daedong Fish.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Sang rushed away, and it was just Hannah and me. Her eyes studied mine. <i>&#x201c;Are you trying to make his high blood pressure go up?&#x201d; </i>she continued in Korean.</p><p>I toed a loose floor tile. Yet one more thing that needed to be fixed. I made a note to grab the contact cement and putty knife in the office.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know how lucky you are?&#x201d; </i>she said. <i>&#x201c;You should be grateful.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Hannah was echoing what everyone in this tangle of Queens thought about my situation. They knew all about my dead mother&#x2014;I could see it in the way their eyes have fixed on me these past twenty years. Just as I knew who borrowed money from whom to start a business and which of those businesses were flourishing and floundering. I knew their children&#x2019;s SAT scores, their college acceptances and subsequent job offers, but I also knew who was dating whom, who was cheating on whom, where they went to get drunk or high.</p><p>In Flushing your personal business was communal property. Such intimate knowledge was stifling. I tapped a hand to my chest, seeking relief. I felt <i>tap-tap-hae</i>&#x2014;an overwhelming discomfort pressing down on you physically, psychologically. When the walls felt as if they were closing in around you, that was <i>tap-tap-hae.</i> When the strap of your bra was fastened too tightly across your chest, that was <i>tap-tap-hae.</i> When you were trying to explain to the likes of Hannah how to turn on the computer, let alone how to operate the mouse, that was unbearably, exasperatingly, <i>tap-tap-hae.</i></p><p>I must have been frowning because suddenly I felt a harsh rap on my forehead: my aunt had flicked a finger at me. <i>&#x201c;Stop that,&#x201d;</i> she snapped<i>. </i>Hannah had a theory that scrunching your face led to early aging. <i>&#x201c;</i>You<i> of all people need to worry about wrinkles.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Then don&#x2019;t touch me, </i>I thought, but if I spoke the words aloud, I&#x2019;d only set off the cycle anew. <i>Don&#x2019;t talk back. You should be grateful. </i>It was easier to comply silently. So one by one I loosened the features of my face. I became expressionless, unreadable.</p><p>Then Hannah pointed down the aisle to the shelves of beans. <i>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;d you make such a big mess over there? Go finish.&#x201d;</i></p><p>As I reshelved the beans, I thought once more about that job at Lowood. Flushing and Food would have been an indistinguishable speck from the office windows. I&#x2019;d have had the chance to see how a real business was run. Not Sang and Hannah&#x2019;s mom-and-pop operation: decidedly rustic, with none of the homespun charm.</p><p>I tapped my hand once more to my chest. <i>Tap-tap-hae. </i>All I wished was for this feeling to go away.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Uncanny Valley</p><p>Every Sunday we went to church. On the way you passed the American Roman Catholic church, the Korean Roman Catholic church, the Chinese Buddhist temple, the Pakistani mosque, and an ever-expanding assortment of Korean Presbyterian and Methodist churches. (The Korean Protestants, unlike their Catholic counterparts, seemed to multiply like Jesus&#x2019;s five loaves and two fishes.) Service was held in one half of a two-family house. After Pastor Bae gave the sermon, the mothers prepared <i>bibimbap</i> in the kitchen for the entire congregation.</p><p>Every Sunday, for as long as I can remember, Eunice Oh and I would find each other after the service. She&#x2019;d always been the same Coke-bottle-glassed girl since childhood. In truth she and I were bound together less by common interests than by our differences from <i>them,</i> the more popular kids in our year: Jessica Bae&#x2014;Pastor Bae&#x2019;s daughter, who just graduated from Columbia. James Kim, who went to Wharton and was about to start at Lehman&#x2014;his parents owned a deli downtown. John Hong, who was at Sophie Davis&#x2014;his father&#x2019;s herbal-medicine practice was down the block from Food. Jenny Lee, who went to Parsons and now did graphic design for <i>CosmoGirl!</i> magazine&#x2014;her mother owned a nail salon on the Upper East Side, but her father graduated from Seoul National and, according to my Aunt Hannah, &#x201c;was too proud to get a menial job.&#x201d;</p><p>But this was our last Sunday together. Eunice was leaving again, this time for good. First it had been for MIT, where she&#x2019;d majored in something called &#x201c;Course VI.&#x201d; Now for San Francisco, where she&#x2019;d gotten an offer from Google. Eunice had had her pick of offers&#x2014;including one from Yahoo!&#x2014;but she went with Google. Why she would take a job with a dot-com immediately after the dot-com crash, no one could understand, but I suspected it had to do with her American boyfriend, a guy called Threepio. He&#x2019;d also accepted a job in Silicon Valley. They were heading out the next day.</p><p>&#x201c;The job search, how goest?&#x201d; Eunice asked, pushing up the nosepiece of her thick glasses with a chubby finger.</p><p>&#x201c;It goest&#x2014;&#x201d; I started, then stopped. You never knew what you were going to get with Eunice. One day she spoke like an Orc, the next like Shakespeare. Sometimes I found myself imitating her without even realizing I was. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going. Actually, ...</p></p><h2>Trapped: How the World Rescued 33 Miners from 2,000 Feet Below the Chilean Desert</h2><p><b>The amazing story of the trapped Chilean miners and their incredible rescue that <i>Publishers Weekly</i> calls &#x201c;a riveting, in-depth recounting of the events that held the world rapt.&#x201d;</b><br><br>In early August 2010, the unthinkable happened when a mine collapsed in Copiap�, Chile, trapping thirty-three miners 2,000 feet below the surface.

Villegas was used to hauling rock out of copper mines in northern Chile, so he had often heard the creaks and moans of the angry earth. He drove on, passing a couple of miners heading down. But as he inched up the ramp he felt a wave hit his truck, &#x201c;like when there is a dynamite explosion.&#x201d; Glancing back, it was as if he were looking down the heart of an erupting volcano. He rushed up the endless, sharp turns of the corkscrewing mine and finally made it to the surface. He, at least, was safe. But when he described the sound and dust cloud to his bosses, no one listened.<br> <br>Someone told Villegas to drive back down, into the mine.<br> <br>This time he could only go so far.

But why is it that some people experience dissonance between their biological sex and their personal identity? Is gender something we are, or something we do? Is our expression of gender a product of biology, or does it develop based on our environment? Are the traditional binary male and female gender roles relevant in an increasingly fluid and flexible world? Sally Hines, whose work on transgender issues draws on the intersections and disconnections of gender, sexuality, and their biological embodiment, is an ideally well-informed author to explore these questions.

Stratton&#x2019;s definitive history of the making of <i>The Wild Bunch</i>, named one of the greatest Westerns of all time by the American Film Institute.</b></p><p>Sam Peckinpah&#x2019;s film <i>The Wild Bunch </i>is the story of a gang of outlaws who are one big steal from retirement. When their attempted train robbery goes awry, the gang flees to Mexico and falls in with a brutal general of the Mexican Revolution, who offers them the job of a lifetime. Conceived by a stuntman, directed by a blacklisted director, and shot in the sand and heat of the Mexican desert, the movie seemed doomed. Instead, it became an instant classic with a dark, violent take on the Western movie tradition. </p><p>In <i>The Wild Bunch</i>, W.K. Stratton tells the fascinating history of the making of the movie and documents for the first time the extraordinary contribution of Mexican and Mexican-American actors and crew members to the movie&#x2019;s success. Shaped by infamous director Sam Peckinpah, and starring such visionary actors as William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Edmond O&#x2019;Brien, and Robert Ryan, the movie was also the product of an industry and a nation in transition. By 1968, when the movie was filmed, the studio system that had perpetuated the myth of the valiant cowboy in movies like <i>The Searchers</i> had collapsed, and America was riled by Vietnam, race riots, and assassinations. <i>The Wild Bunch </i>spoke to America in its moment, when war and senseless violence seemed to define both domestic and international life. </p><p><i>The Wild Bunch </i>is an authoritative history of the making of a movie and the era behind it.</p></p><p><b>W.K. Stratton</b> is the author of five books of nonfiction and three of poetry. He has written for <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, <i>Outside</i>, <i>GQ</i>, and<i> Texas Monthly</i>, and was named a fellow of the Texas Institute of Letters in 2017. He is a longtime resident of Austin, Texas.<p>"In his detailed and passionately argued history of <i>The Wild Bunch</i>, writer W.K. Stratton takes the debate to a higher level and convincingly positions the film as the best Western ever made&#x2015;and among the greatest of movies. Stratton collects the kinds of elements required for a lively movie backstory: a talented if irascible director, quirky cast and crew members, a difficult location shoot and a controversial reception by moviegoers and critics. Best of all, he recounts how an idea becomes a film and the creative, economic and fate-driven roadblocks it faces." - <i>Associated Press</i></p><p>"Reading W.K. Stratton&#x2019;s fine book after watching <i>The Wild Bunch</i> can make for a rich aesthetic feast." - <i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>"Definitive . . . Stratton&#x2019;s book is part making-of chronicle, part appreciation, part personal reminiscence. . . . He&#x2019;s not a film critic, but a passionate and knowledgeable generalist who knows how to drill deep." - <i>Vulture</i></p><p>"Sam Peckinpah&#x2019;s classic western is lovingly picked over in this obsessive treatment of its making and reception." - <i>New York Times Book Review, in New &amp; Noteworthy</i></p><p>"Insightful and engaging, Stratton&#x2019;s book will hold the attention of even those who despise the movie." - <i>Roundup Magazine</i></p><p>"No person of sensibility who has seen <i>The Wild Bunch</i> has not felt the extraordinary richness of lived experience that courses throughout the film. This is one of many things that lifts it far above the action genre and the Western to the epic. It is a singular achievement of W. K. Stratton&#x2019;s book on its making that he shows this was not adventitious . . . Stratton documents how Peckinpah&#x2019;s masterpiece became not only a great film but one of the enduringly great artworks of the past century." - <i>Paul Seydor, author of THE AUTHENTIC DEATH AND CONTENTIOUS AFTERLIFE OF PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID: The Untold Story of Peckinpah&#x2019;s Last Western Film</i></p><p>"Stratton&#x2019;s book examines the history of the Western and details the ambition and, at times, lunacy of making what has become an American classic." - <i>Newsweek</i></p><p>"Muscular study . . . Stratton pulls together big strands of story: the history of the Mexican revolutionary period, Peckinpah's own fascination with Mexico, the history of U.S.-Mexico relations, the history of moviemaking itself. . . Essential reading for fans of the epochal (and reportedly soon to be remade) movie as well as movie-history and Western buffs generally." - <i>starred review, 11 Early 2019 Books We Love, Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Stratton paints a wonderfully full portrait of director Sam Peckinpah and his quest for a more realistic depiction of violence at a time when the brutality of the Vietnam War was increasingly penetrating American living rooms. . . . What&#x2019;s most striking here is the depth of Stratton&#x2019;s research, with attention given to every aspect of, and player in, the film. This engaging, well-researched book belongs in every library and in the hands of every student of cinema." - <i>starred review, Library Journal</i></p><p>"Stratton does a fine job of putting the film in its historical context . . . THE WILD BUNCH is a valuable addition to the literature of American film history and will be greeted by Wild Bunch devotees with adoration." - <i>starred review, Booklist</i></p><p>"Stratton&#x2019;s thorough research yields a fascinating perspective on how Peckinpah created a western of unparalleled realism and intensity." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"My favorite kind of film books tend to be those that go behind the scenes, that provide inside looks at how celebrated films were put together, [THE WILD BUNCH] falls squarely in that category." - <i>Critic's Choice, Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>"Stratton loves &#x201c;The Wild Bunch&#x201d; (he succinctly writes, &#x2018;I've never seen a better movie&#x2019;), but this is not a gushing fan letter. Stratton's meticulous research, exhaustive interviews and scholarship all combine to create a fascinating portrait of a maverick filmmaker working at the top of his game and pushing the boundaries of moviemaking." - <i>Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>"Stratton's anecdote-packed book explores when, why and how <i>The</i> <i>Wild Bunch</i> was made." - <i>Dallas Morning News</i></p><p>"Stratton has written an ambitious and lively history . . . At the heart of [THE WILD BUNCH] are dozens of informative and colorful interviews, conducted with everyone from screenwriters and stuntmen to Hollywood producers and Mexican film stars." - <i>San Diego Union Tribune</i></p><p>"Stratton provides a casually written but carefully researched account of the making of one of the key films of its time. In so doing, he also helps to show how Westerns have managed to maintain their firm hold on the imaginations of American moviegoers." - <i>Commentary</i></p><p>"Stratton has steeped himself in every last detail of the genesis and production of a movie he plainly knows by heart. He&#x2019;s also a spirited guide to Peckinpah&#x2019;s abrasive worldview, which he&#x2019;s no less plainly besotted with. But partly for that reason, his book inadvertently doubles as a reminder of the hoary time capsule Wild Bunch aficionados now inhabit, whether they like it or not. They&#x2019;re sure to be delighted by Stratton&#x2019;s lively, massively informed chronicle of how The Wild Bunch came to be." - <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Review</i></p><p>"The book digs into how timing and lucky coincidences brought the cast and crew together in Mexico to make the movie happen." - <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i></p><p>"Stratton's book goes into fine detail about the origin of the story . . . If you're the kind of movie fan who loves to read the trivia offered by imdb.com, Stratton's &#x2018;The Wild Bunch&#x2019; is a gold mine." - <i>Oklahoman</i></p><p><i>"</i>An essential addition to the Peckinpah bookshelf. His vivid account of the hugely difficult creation of the classic western is engrossing" - <i>Film Stage</i></p></p><h2>My Land and My People: The Original Autobiography of His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet</h2><p>Schooled behind ancient palace walls to become the leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama has become a spiritual leader to the world and a leading civil rights advocate.

After soaking in a bubble bath, a rambunctious little boy runs through the house in his birthday suit. His parents' initial facial expressions suggest that they do not share in their son's enthusiasm, but eventually Mom lightens up. The exuberant youngster imagines the fun of attending school, playing on the playground, and dancing the Hokey Pokey, all in the nude. Each time he stops for a cookie snack, he settles down a bit. When the lad puts on a cape and starts to feel cold, he changes his mind about the value of clothing. In the end, the exhausted boy falls asleep in his dinosaur hooded pajamas. Black's peppy writing style sets a fast pace for the story, and the child's behavior is believable. There's also a lesson here about one practical reason for wearing clothing. The whimsical digital artwork adds energy and color to the story. Characters' moods are nicely shown through their changing facial expressions, while the illustrator's choices of poses for the child leave anatomical details to the reader's imagination.

His spiritual quest continues to unfold, illuminating the emergence of a modern Western shamanism, the phenomenon of spirit possession, the conveyance of the souls of the dead, and the true nature of the human spirit.</p><p>Anthropologist Hank Wesselman&#x2019;s spiritual awakening began on the island of Hawaii through a series of spontaneous visionary encounters that are documented in his internationally acclaimed book Spiritwalker, ISBN: 0-55337-837-6. His dramatic accounts of his relationship with Nainoa, a fellow mystic and kahuna initiate, resumed in Medicinemaker, ISBN: 0-55310-774-7, revealing the true purpose of their profound, yet cryptic contact. Hank is also the author of Visionseeker, hardcover edition, ISBN: 1-56170-753-8. He currently resides in Northern California, where he teaches at American River College and Sierra College and offers experiential workshops and presentations in core shamanism worldwide.Dr. Wesselman is an anthropologist who thinks of himself as a modern-day shaman, one who specializes in the study of the spiritual ancestry other cultures--� la Carlos Casteneda. VISIONSEEKER, his third book, details his many encounters with spirits who lived at other times. Although spiced with musical bridges at the beginning and end of each side, the book overall is a disappointment. Wesselman speaks in a monotonous drone, sounding as if he is giving a six-hour lecture. His voice is a flat monotone, even during intense or emotional passages. Like his students, audio listeners may have difficulty staying awake.

Shamsuddin is Professor of Pathology at the University of Maryland, School of Medicine and President of IP-6 Research Inc, in Baltimore. Dr Shamsuddin graduated from Dhaka Medical College, University of Dhaka in 1972. Following Internship in Massachusetts and Residency training in pathology in Maryland, he was certified by the American Board of Pathology in 1977. In 1980, he received Ph.D. degree from the University of Maryland for his work on colon carcinogenesis. He joined the faculty of the University of Maryland as an Instructor in 1977, and rose through the ranks of Assistant Professor and Associate Professor with tenure to become a full Professor in 1988. For his excellence in teaching he received the Best Teacher award from the medical students many times, including the coveted &#34;Golden Apple Award&#34; by the American Medical Students&#39; Association in 1999. Dr. Shamsuddin has been studying the process of cancer formation and prevention of cancer since 1975. His research in the colon carcinogenesis resulted in the development of a very simple and accurate screening test for cancer and precancerous lesions of not only colon, but also of the lung, breast and possibly cervix. This rather inexpensive test detects cancers at a very early stage, even before they have formed, making it a general cancer screening test. His book on the subject &#34;Diagnostic Assays for Colon Cancer&#34; by CRC Press (1991) was written for health-care professionals. In mid 1985 Dr. Shamsuddin started his pioneering experiments on the anti-cancer property of inositol and inositol hexaphosphate (IP-6) - natural constituents of cereals and legumes such as rice, corn, beans etc., even though IP-6 had been castigated as an anti-nutrient for nearly a century. For the next two decades, he has reconfirmed and expanded his groundbreaking studies to show the efficacy of IP-6 and inositol against different cancers in various experimental models. Dr. Shamsuddin&#39;s previous book on this &#34;IP6: Nature&#39;s Revolutionary Cancer Fighter&#34; was published by Kensington Publishing Corporation, New York, 1998. Aside from these Dr. Shamsuddin has contributed numerous book-chapters and published over 200 scientific papers.

Pumped through towering, home-built speakers, often directly onto the thronged streets of events like the Notting Hill Carnival, the pulsating bass lines of reggae, dub, rave, jungle, trip hop, dubstep, and grime have shaped the worlds of several generations of British youth culture but have often been overlooked by historians obsessed with swinging London, punk, and Britpop.</p><p>This oral history, consisting of new interviews conducted by respected dance music writer Joe Muggs, and accompanied by dramatic portraits by Brian David Stevens, presents the story of the bassline of Britain, in the words of those who lived and shaped it. Features interviews with Dubmaster Dennis Bovell, Norman Jay MPE, Youth, Adrian Sherwood, Skream, Rinse FM's Sarah Lockhart and many others.</p></p><p>Joe Muggs has been a fixture in underground music for quarter of a century as a DJ, promoter, and most notably as a journalist for the <i>Guardian</i>, the<i> Telegraph</i>, <i>FACT</i>, <i>Mixmag</i>, and the<i> Wire</i>.<br><br>Brian David Stevens is a photographer based in London, who has worked extensively in documentary and portrait work as well as art photography.

We hear from the persecutors themselves: the leaders of the Nazi party, the members of the Protestant and Catholic hierarchies, the university elites, and the heads of the business community. Most telling of all, perhaps, are the testimonies of ordinary German citizens, who in the main acquiesced to increasing waves of dismissals, segregation, humiliation, impoverishment, expulsion, and violence. </p></p><p><p>Born in Prague, Saul Friedl�nder spent his boyhood in Nazi-occupied France. He is a professor of history at UCLA, and has written numerous books on Nazi Germany and World War II.</p>An eminent Holocaust historian gives voice to both the perpetrators and victims of Nazi Germany's prewar persecutions. Historian and memoirist Friedl&#x201e;nder (Reflections of Nazism, 1984; When Memory Comes, 1979; etc.) here offers the first part of a two-volume study of the Holocaust. This eloquent, richly documented history focuses on the period from the rise of the Nazis to the onset of war in 1939, and traces how the Nazi regime gradually drew the German nation into a war against its Jewish population, first harassing, then isolating, and finally openly attacking Jews throughout Germany. The author relies heavily on the words of both notorious racists and everyday Germans, as well as the reactions of Jews and gentile critics of the regime to its increasingly violent actions, drawing from letters, diaries, speeches, and newspaper articles. The first shot was aimed at the ``excessive influence'' of Germany's Jews on her cultural life, and it's documented here with excerpts from the letters of famous composers, painters, and writers, including Thomas Mann's correspondence with Albert Einstein. This portrait of the German people is not unmixed: While we encounter professors who were all too pleased to have their Jewish department heads and colleagues dismissed as threats to Aryan culture, we also read a German businessman's description of the seizure of Jewish shops by entrepreneurs who were ``like vultures swarming down . . . their tongues hanging out with greed, to feed upon the Jewish carcass.'' The institutionalized ostracism and pauperization of Germany's Jews was fueled, according to Friedl&#x201e;nder, by ``a synthesis of murderous rage'' and polluted idealism, created by the Nazi regime and embraced by the German people. Not surprisingly, the notes and list of works cited here take up 80 pages. The exhaustive spade work makes this the richest, fullest study of its kind. The reader comes as close as one would ever want to get to Nazi Germany of the 1930s. (32 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Then along came Sam, and it was love at first sight? and lots of little Sams! While the cats are perfectly happy stampeding through Uncle Andy?s art studio and frolicking among his soup boxes, the humans know things have to change. So Uncle Andy devises a brilliant plan to make his cats famous?and easier to find homes for.<p> James Warhola?s childhood memories of trips to New York City to visit his uncle, Andy Warhol, inspired this warm, funny story of the famous artist?s house full of cats. Kids will pore over the illustrations trying to spot all the Sams, as well as some very clever mice.<br><br></p></p><p>James Warhola wrote and illustrated <i>Uncle Andy&#x2019;s</i>: A faabbbulous visit with<i>Andy Warhol,</i> a Book Sense 76 selection.

He lives in Tivoli, New York.Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;In <i>Uncle Andy's</i> (Putnam, 2003), Warhola mentions that his famous uncle lived with his mother and owned 25 cats named Sam. That throwaway detail has been developed into its own book. <i>Cats</i> tells the story of how Andy Warhol and Bubba start with a single feline named Hester, acquire a companion for her named Sam, and end up with 25 kittens that look like their dad. Overrun by cats in a house already filled top to bottom with Warhol's art, the artist and his mother create two books about the Sams, which lead to happy relocations for the kittens. Warhola has masterfully combined a childlike delight at the almost alien world that his celebrated relative lives in, while impressing on the audience the idea that even famous artists have to deal with worldly matters. The natural playfulness of the 25 Sams adds zest to an already eclectic household and provides Warhola ample opportunity for cheerfully chaotic illustrations of cats and Pop Art trying to coexist. Pictures such as a stampede of Sams running between Warhol's legs or the exhausted artist asleep in bed with only his trademark white hair visible among a sea of kitties are delightful. Young readers will be glad for this opportunity to revisit the tall, skinny house in New York.&#x2014;<i>Kara Schaff Dean, Walpole Public Library, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The running vocabulary and commentary are meant to provide everything necessary to read each page. Lucian&#39;s A True Story is a great text for intermediate readers. Its breathless narrative does not involve many complex sentences or constructions; there is some unusual vocabulary and a few departures from Attic Greek, but for the most part it is a straightforward narrative that is fun and interesting by one of antiquity&#39;s cleverest authors. In A True Story, Lucian parodies accounts of fanciful adventures and travel to incredible places by authors such as Ctesias and Iambulus. The story&#39;s combination of mockery and learning makes it an excellent example of the Greek literature of the imperial period.

She was more husky than fat, with too much eye makeup, and hair that had been dyed a nasty shade of reddish orange. When I didn&#x2019;t immediately respond she glanced my way, as if to assure herself that I really was awake and aware. &#x201c;You realize that, right?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re pretty damn lucky to be alive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Um...okay,&#x201d; I muttered. Beneath the sheet I ran a hand over my stomach, frowned. &#x201c;Have I been in a coma or something?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>Her thin lips pinched together. &#x201c;A coma? No. You were brought in a few hours ago.&#x201d; She paused, set her hands on her hips. &#x201c;You overdosed.&#x201d;<br><br>I scrubbed a hand over my face, shook my head. &#x201c;No, I was in a car accident,&#x201d; I insisted. &#x201c;I remember being injured.&#x201d; Didn&#x2019;t I? &#x201c;I was bleeding,&#x201d; I added, less certain as I ran my hand over the unbroken skin of my stomach again.<br><br>She gave a dismissive snort. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not a scratch on you. You must have hallucinated it.&#x201d; Her eyes narrowed with contempt and disapproval. I didn&#x2019;t care. I was used to seeing that when people looked at me.<br><br>Glass and blood and metal. A broken body beside me. Teeth and hunger. Gobbets of flesh ripped away....<br><br>Cold sweat broke out on the back of my neck. How could that have been a hallucination? Hallucinations were strange and hazy and jumbled. I knew. I&#x2019;d had a few.<br><br>Making an annoyed noise in the back of her throat, she snagged the chart from the end of the bed. &#x201c;Unknown white female. Hmmm. Do you remember your name, sweetheart?&#x201d; She flicked her eyes back up to me and gave me a sugary-bitchy smile that didn&#x2019;t have an ounce of true concern in it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I know my damn name,&#x201d; I snarled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Angel Crawford.&#x201d; I wanted to add, <i>And you can write it down with the pencil that&#x2019;s stuck up your ass</i>, but I managed to hold it back. I knew that nurses had the power to make your life suck worse than it already did, and it was clear that this bitch considered me to be one step away from starring in my own loser reality show. Screw her. I was at least two steps away.<br><br>The nurse gave a sniff as if she didn&#x2019;t truly believe I was smart or sober enough to know who I was. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see what all was in your system&#x2014;THC, hydrocodone, alprazolam, oxycodone....&#x201d; She rattled off a couple of other drug names that sounded long and scary while I scowled blackly at her. After she finished she gave me a look full of smug satisfaction, hung the chart back up and left the room in a pompous waddle before I could respond. Good thing too, because what I wanted to say to her would have been too much even for a Jerry Springer special.<br><br>My anger withered as soon as she was gone, overwhelmed by my confusion and sick fear. I lifted the sheet up to see for myself&#x2014;again&#x2014;that I was uninjured.<br> I struggled to make sense of it. I remembered the blood. Lots of it. There&#x2019;d been some sort of long gash across my stomach, and I had a nauseating memory of seeing the jagged end of white bone poking from my thigh, blood pumping out and all over. But now there was nothing out of place. No scrapes, no bruises. Just perfectly normal flesh all over. A coma could explain that, right? A couple of months or so, enough time for me to heal up.<br><br>Except that I didn&#x2019;t have any scars, either.<br><br>Sighing, I dropped my head back to the pillow. I hadn&#x2019;t been in a coma. The nurse wasn&#x2019;t lying or messing with my head.<br><br>No, I was simply a loser.<br><br>Overdose. Great. Well, this was a new low for me, and it didn&#x2019;t help that it was totally believable. The only possibly shocking aspect was that it hadn&#x2019;t happened sooner. I didn&#x2019;t remember taking as many drugs as the bitch nurse had said, but the fact that I was in the ER was proof enough that I obviously had. The nurse hadn&#x2019;t gone and altered my lab results either. I did that all by myself, the old-fashioned way.<br><br>Weary depression rolled over me as I stared at the speckled tile of the ceiling. Beyond the door I could hear the frenzy of a stretcher being wheeled by and voices raised in brief concern. I knew what would happen next. Some social worker or psychologist would come in and tell me I needed rehab or counseling or some crap like that, which was a stupid suggestion since I didn&#x2019;t have money or insurance. Or worse, I&#x2019;d get a seventy-two-hour commitment for &#x201c;psychiatric evaluation,&#x201d; since I was clearly a danger to myself, and I&#x2019;d probably end up in some nasty charity ward. There was no way I was gonna put up with that. I felt perfectly fine now and more than ready to get the hell out of here.<br><br>I kicked the sheet away and slid off the bed. The tile was smooth and cold against my bare feet. I needed shoes and clothes. I was wearing the stupid hospital gown, and my own clothes were so covered with blood that I&#x2019;d draw all sorts of attention if I tried to walk out in them.<br><br>I shook my head. No, the blood had been a hallucination.<br><br>There was no sign of my clothes in the room. No closets&#x2014;only one cabinet and an intimidating variety of medical equipment. I started to move toward the cabinet, remembering the IV a step before I accidentally yanked it out of my arm, then spent a couple of seconds trying to decide if I could carry the bag out with me instead of pulling the needle out. Needles freaked me out, but leaving it in would probably be worse than removing it myself. Hell, that was the only reason I&#x2019;d never gone for the harder drugs like heroin or meth. Too chickenshit to stick a needle into me to get that kind of high. Pills were easy. Plus I could tell myself that I wasn&#x2019;t a real druggie.<br><br>Except that now I&#x2019;d almost killed myself just as dead as if I&#x2019;d ODed on heroin.<br><br>Pushing that unpleasant thought out of my mind, I peeled off the tape on my arm then clenched my teeth and pulled the needle out. I braced myself against the wave of nausea that always hit me whenever I saw blood&#x2014;especially my own&#x2014;but to my relief it didn&#x2019;t hurt at all, and I didn&#x2019;t feel sick. A tiny bead of blood welled up from the puncture site, and I wiped it away with the hem of my gown before I even remembered that I was supposed to be nauseated by it.<br><br>Maybe that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;d hallucinated about being covered in blood? There wasn&#x2019;t much that would freak me out more than that.<br><br>The door to the room opened again, startling me, and I dropped the IV line with a guilty flush as a different nurse walked in. She was a lot younger than the other one&#x2014;maybe in her early twenties or so, with sleek blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail and the sort of fresh no-makeup look I wished I could pull off. I looked like death without makeup, and while my hair was blonde as well, it was that way because I dyed it myself, which meant it was a frizzy, damaged mess.<br><br>Her eyes flicked to the discarded IV, but she didn&#x2019;t seem to be upset that I&#x2019;d removed it. &#x201c;I wanted to make sure you were awake and decent,&#x201d; she said with a smile that was kinder than I expected. &#x201c;There are a couple of detectives here who want to talk to you.&#x201d;<br><br>A frisson of terror shot through me. &#x201c;Wh-why?&#x201d; I asked, though I was pretty sure I knew. They were here to take me to jail. My probation officer had found out about the drug use and my probation was being revoked. Or they wanted me to squeal about where I got my drugs.<br><br>I must have gone pale because she closed the door and gave me a reassuring smile. &#x201c;They only want to talk to you. You&#x2019;re going to be fine. Here,&#x201d; she said, gently but firmly pushing me back to sit on the bed. She didn&#x2019;t make me lie back down&#x2014;simply pulled the bed sheet around so that my lower body and bare feet were covered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. I know I can&#x2019;t talk to anyone with any sort of authority if I&#x2019;m half-naked,&#x201d; she said with a wink.<br><br>Her unexpected niceness had me a little off-balance, especially after the open hostility of the previous nurse. &#x201c;Where are my other clothes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You, uh, weren&#x2019;t wearing any when you were brought in.&#x201d;<br> <i><br>Oh, shit</i>. I swallowed hard. &#x201c;Did they take them off in the ambulance?&#x201d; Surely it wouldn&#x2019;t be as bad as if I&#x2019;d&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;The cops found you on the side of the road...naked.&#x201d; Her face twisted in embarrassed sympathy.<br><br>My throat tightened. &#x201c;Was I&#x2014;I mean, had I been...?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t say the word.<br><br>Her eyes widened. &#x201c;No!&#x201d; She shook her head emphatically. &#x201c;No, the doctor, um, checked. You weren&#x2019;t assaulted.&#x201d;<br><br>I scrubbed at my face and fought the urge to cry. Overdose and naked on the side of the road. This kept getting better and better. And not even the victim of a crime, just a stupid drugged-out skank.<br><br>The nurse made a concerned noise in her throat, reached out and gave my upper arms a firm rub. &#x201c;Relax now. Everything&#x2019;s going to be fine. These detectives want to have a word with you, then you&#x2019;ll be ready to get out of here.&#x201d; She turned and left before I could form any sort of coherent response.<br> <i><br>Right. Everything&#x2019;s going to be fine</i>, I thought with a sour laugh. She didn&#x2019;t know. She couldn&#x2019;t possibly understand why I was freaking.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t have to stew in my panic for long. No sooner had the door swung shut behind the blonde nurse than it opened again and two detectives walked in. But they weren&#x2019;t probation officers or narcotics detectives. That threw me. At least I was pretty sure they weren&#x2019;t narcs. Those guys usually went around in jeans and T-shirts, but these two were in dress shirts and ties. The first one in was a burly guy&#x2014;at least six feet tall and stocky with a bit of a pudge working around his middle, blondish brown hair, and a scruffy-looking mustache. The second detective wasn&#x2019;t as tall, but he was big in a muscled way. No pudge on him. I could tell he worked out, and hard. He had dark hair, dark eyes, and an equally dark expression on his face. Both had guns, badges, and handcuffs on their belts.<br><br>In other words, they intimidated the ever-living shit out of me simply by walking into the room.<br>&#x201c;Ms. Crawford,&#x201d; the burly one began, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Detective Ben Roth and this is Detective Mike Abadie.&#x201d; He cocked his head toward the dark-haired detective. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re with the Saint Edwards Parish Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, and we&#x2019;d appreciate it if you could take a couple of minutes to answer some questions for us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do I need a lawyer?&#x201d; I blurted. The two men exchanged a quick glance. Oh, great. Nice way to start. Now I sounded guilty as all hell.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s completely up to you, Ms. Crawford,&#x201d; Detective Roth said. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;re only here to see if you might have witnessed anything that could help us solve a crime. You&#x2019;re not under any sort of suspicion at this time.&#x201d; His expression remained serious but his eyes were kind. At least, I wanted to believe that. The other detective looked like he had a permanent scowl on his face. Maybe they were about to play good cop bad cop on me. It would probably work, too. I always fell for that psychological shit. Especially when I was confused and stressed. Like right now.<br><br>I gripped the sheet in my hands. &#x201c;Uh, sure. What...um, what crime?&#x201d;<br><br>Detective Abadie cleared his throat. &#x201c;You were found on Sweet Bayou Road right off Highway 180.&#x201d; His lips pressed together and I could see the same derision in his eyes that I&#x2019;d seen in the red-haired nurse&#x2019;s. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t know why I was in here, &#x2019;cause of privacy laws or whatever, but he sure as hell had his suspicions.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, doing my damnedest to not hunch under his gaze. &#x201c;If you say so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At about the same time,&#x201d; he continued, eyes hard and flat, &#x201c;a body was found a few miles further down Sweet Bayou Road. It had been decapitated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wh-what?&#x201d; I said, staring at him in horror.<br><br>&#x201c;Decapitated. It means that his head was chopped off,&#x201d; he explained, tone thoroughly patronizing.<br><br>A sudden burst of anger managed to burn away a good portion of the panic and fear that had been controlling me up until then. &#x201c;I know what &#x2018;decapitated&#x2019; means,&#x201d; I replied with a scowl. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know anything about this. I sure as hell didn&#x2019;t do it!&#x201d; The two men exchanged another quick glance and a sliver of the fear came back. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think I did it, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>Detective Roth shook his head firmly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not a suspect at this time, Ms. Crawford. However, right now you&#x2019;re the only possible witness we have. Anything you can remember might be useful.&#x201d;<br><br>I swallowed. <i>At this time</i>. He kept saying that. In other words I sure as shit hadn&#x2019;t been ruled out, even though I knew there was no way I would have chopped some guy&#x2019;s head off&#x2014;no matter how high I might have been.<br><br>So why did I remember blood...?<br><br>I took a shaking breath. No. There was no way. I wasn&#x2019;t a killer. &#x201c;Sweet Bayou Road?&#x201d; I asked, stalling for time to get my thoughts into something other then a jumbled mess.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you were found,&#x201d; Detective Roth said patiently. &#x201c;What do you remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I...don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Sweet Bayou Road was only about five minutes down the highway from where I lived, but there wasn&#x2019;t a whole lot on it. A few fishing camps near the end, and the rest of it was several miles of desolate and twisty road through the marsh. &#x201c;I mean, I was at Pillar&#x2019;s Bar with my boyfriend. We had a fight and...&#x201d; I rubbed my eyes, odd flashes of the hallucination swimming through my head.<br> <i><br>Blood and pain...I thought I was dying. No, I died. But then I was hungry. Starving-to-death hungry....</i><br><br>I took an unsteady breath. &#x201c;Then I was out on the road, and there was an ambulance.&#x201d;<br> <i><br>I was arguing with the paramedics after they got me into the ambulance, begging for something to eat because I was so damn hungry. Maybe that&#x2019;s why I didn&#x2019;t walk into the stupid white light. Maybe I knew they wouldn&#x2019;t have anything to eat down that way.</i><br><br>&#x201c;I must have passed out.&#x201d; I looked up at the two men. &#x201c;Then I woke up here. Sorry.&#x201d;<br> <i><br>No pain. No hunger. No clue.</i><br><br>Detective Abadie let out an exasperated snort. &#x201c;Why were you out there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I guess I was trying to walk home.&#x201d; Walking home from the bar would definitely rank as one of the more boneheaded things I&#x2019;d done in my life. In other words, totally believable. And somewhere along the way I&#x2019;d decided to strip naked. That must have been one helluva high.<br><br>Detective Roth tugged a hand through his hair, clearly frustrated. &#x201c;I need you to think real hard, Angel. Did you see anyone? Any cars? Someone walking along the road?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I mumbled, hunching my shoulders. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>Fatigue and disappointment etched itself across Detective Roth&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;All right, Miss Crawford. If you think of anything else&#x2014;anything at all&#x2014;please give me a call.&#x201d; He pulled out a business card and handed it to me.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure thing,&#x201d; I said, obediently taking the card.<br><br>A sour expression twisted Detective Abadie&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Ben,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re wasting our time.&#x201d; He turned and stalked out. I couldn&#x2019;t even get annoyed at his reaction. I <i>had</i> been a waste of their time.<br><br>Detective Roth let out a low sigh but gave me a tired smile. &#x201c;I appreciate your talking to us, Miss Crawford,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I hope you get to feeling better.&#x201d; Then he too was out the door, and I was alone in the room once again.<br><br>Wrung out and depressed, I dropped the card into the wastebasket. This day couldn&#x2019;t get much worse.<br><br>...</p><h2>The Twentieth Maine: A Classic Story of Joshua Chamberlain and His Volunteer Regiment</h2><p>We went into the fight with 386, all told--358 guns. Every pioneer and musician who would carry a musket went into the ranks. Even the sick and footsore, who could not keep up in the march, came up as soon as they could find their regiments, and took their places in line of battle, while it was battle, indeed. --Col. Joshua Chamberlain The fascinating story of Joshua Chamberlain and his volunteer regiment, the Twentieth Maine, is reprinted with a new foreword by Civil War historian and UCLA professor Joan Waugh. Pullen&#39;s classic and highly acclaimed book tells how Chamberlain and his men fought at Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville on their way to the pivotal battle of Gettysburg. There, on July 2, 1863, at Little Round Top, they heroically saved the left flank of the Union battle line. The Twentieth Maine&#39;s remarkable story ends with the surrender of Lee&#39;s troops at Appomattox.Considered by Civil War historians to be one of the best regimental histories ever written, this beloved standard of American history is now available in a new Stackpole edition. Includes maps, photographs, and drawings from the original edition.</p><p>17 b/w photos, 10 mapsJohn J. Pullen, a renowned Civil War historian, also wrote Joshua Chamberlain: A Hero&#39;s Life and Legacy (978-0-8117-0886-9). He lived in Maine, writing about the Civil War until his death in 2003.</p><h2>Ways to Nurture the Relationship with God</h2><p>There is an inner hunger and thirst in us, which is a sign of our longing for God. Often this longing is deeper than words. Sometimes it surfaces and we ask: <br>What can nourish the deep needs of our spirit? <br> What can feed the great capacities of our heart and mind? <br>What can enable us to enjoy God's presence in our lives? <br> What can activate our enormous potential to be God's image in our world? <br> The meditations in this book offer ways to feed this hunger and thirst--our soul's longing for "good news of great joy" (Luke 2: 10). They explore and illuminate the Christian message and are the fruit of Sophia Cavaletti's meditations with adults gathered together as listeners to the Word. Because this book arose from actual encounters, the writers invite you to enter into it as a fellow listener, meditating on scripture and liturgy alongside them.</p><p><b> Sofia Cavalletti </b> <br> Sofia Cavalletti received her degree in Hebrew and Comparative Semitic Languages from the Universita La Sapienza in Rome. She has contributed to several editions of the Bible (Old Testament), translating Isaiah, Leviticus, Ruth, Esther, Judith, and Proverbs, and to international publications on biblical studies. Dr. Cavalletti is also a specialist in the field of ecumenism, espcially the Jewish-Christian relationship. In 1954, Sofia Cavalletti founded, together with Gianna Gobbi, the Good Shepherd Centre of Catechesis for children and adults, with which she is still involved. This work has spread to five continents through lectures, seminars, courses and publications, which have been translated into many languages. In the course of more than 50 years' experience with children from the age of two years and upward, they have revealed unexpected capacities in their relationship with the Transcendent. Children from very diverse geographical, social and cultural environments have always responded to this relationship with a profound sense of joy, which puts them in a particular state of peace, such as to make us think that this relationship satisfies a vital need within children. <p> <b> Patricia Coulter</b> <br> Patricia Coulter received her Doctorate in Ministry from the University of St. Michael's College, University of Toronto. Throughout their long friendship, she has collaborated with Dr. Cavalletti in courses, various initiatives, translations, and as coauthor with her of <i>The Good Shepherd and the Child: A Joyful Journey.</i> <br> In 2004, Dr. Coulter was the recipient of the <i>Pro Ecclesia et Poniface</i> Cross for her ministry with children and adults. She is Senior Consultant for Spiritual Formation, Archdiocese of Toronto, and an adjunct Professor for the Faculty of Theology, University of St. Michael's College. Along with her writing, Patricia is also involved in the ministry of spiritual direction and retreats.</p>Reading Ways to Nurture the Relationship with God is a bit like pulling up a chair to join Sofia and Patricia for a meditation that touches the heart and mind. It is an excellent resource not only for those of us involved as catechists and formation leaders in Catechesis of the Good Shepherd but for anyone looking for a helpful way to linger over and grow in understanding of the scriptures. The rich words and diagrams stayed with me long after I had put the book away. In the chapter on the Good Shepherd Sofia says of Psalm 23: This is a real jewel. Those same words aptly describe this splendid book. Indeed, it is a real jewel! --Donna Turner, Catechist of children and the coordinator for Catechesis of the Good Shepherd, St. Philip Episcopal Church in Memphis<br><br>For decades now, catechists across North America have shared tidbits of Sofia Cavalletti s adult reflections in their formation courses. Now finally we have many of these reflections in written form to meditate upon at length. Cavalletti has been recognized internationally for her unparalleled understanding of the religious potential of children. These meditations betray her equally unparalleled devotion to life-long scripture study, rooted in the original biblical languages. --Ann M. Garrido, DMin, Associate Professor of Homiletics, Director of the DMin and MAPS-CGS Programs, Aquinas Institute of Theology<br><br>This book is an invitation to draw close and listen deeply to God s full and abundant love for us. The gift of these rich and deep meditations will nurture our hearts and minds and enable us to more deeply enjoy God s presence in our lives. Many thanks, Sofia and Patricia! --Mary Mirrione, National Director of the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd</p><h2>Wolves vs. Zombies: Secrets of an Overworld Survivor, #3</h2><p>This adventure series is created especially for readers who love the fight of good vs. evil, magical academies like Hogwarts in the Harry Potter saga, and games like Minecraft, Terraria, and Pokemon GO.<br><br>With zombie attacks threatening their town, Will&#x2019;s older brother urges him to act responsible by staying home to protect the villagers.

What's the secret to getting into a happy marriage and, even more important, staying in one? Now world-renowed psychiatrist Dr. William Glasser and his wife, Carleen Glasser, update their classic guide to successful marriages, <em>Staying Together,</em> for couples young and old. As they examine the questions of why some marriages work and others fail, the Glassers advise readers on how to create loving and happy relationships by applying Dr. Glasser's trademark "choice theory." The result is a wealth of new information about who would make a compatible partner and how to improve any relationship.</p><p><p>William Glasser, M.D., is a world-renowned psychiatrist who lectures widely. His numerous books have sold 1.7 million copies, and he has trained thousands of counselors in his Choice Theory and Reality Therapy approaches. He is also the president of the William Glasser Institute in Los Angeles.</p><br><br><p>Carleen Glasser, M.A., is a senior instructor at the William Glasser Institute and the author of two books for children.</p>My Marriage Is a Mystery<p>A while back we received the following e-mail:</p><i>To: wginst@earthlink.net<br>From: Cherylm@mail.anywhere.com<br>Subject: query on marriage<br></i><p>I have sent this query to the websites of several well-known psychologists and psychiatrists, but to tell you the truth, I'm not even sure I want an answer. I'm even worried that what you may tell me will make me feel worse than I feel now. The other possibility is that there isn't an answer; there certainly doesn't seem to be one. I won't be surprised if you tell me that the marriage I have is the way marriage is and I should just accept it.</p><p>To begin, I guess the best way to put it is, that for me, marriage is a mystery. It became a mystery a few years after we married, and in the twenty-plus years I've been married to Larry, my husband, it remains a mystery. Larry doesn't know I'm writing this letter, but as far as I can see, it's as much a mystery to him as it is to me. On the surface, we have a good marriage. We don't fight or argue much and, I guess compared to their marriages, my friends tell me I have one of the best marriages in our circle. But it's not good enough for me.</p><p>My problem is that there's no spark in our relationship. To put it in two words: It's dull. There's nothing to look forward to. It just goes along month after month, the ups never high, the lows rarely low. Our marriage reminds me of the heart monitor on ER when the patient dies, flat, no more beeps. It's not that we don't do things or see people we enjoy. But the enjoyment is more as individuals than as a couple. For example, with our friends he's with the men and I'm with the women. What we don't seem to be able to do anymore is enjoy each other. When we're together by ourselves, there's no real substance to our relationship.</p><p>More and more, I think about the beginning, about how much in love we were. How every moment we could spend together was so precious. How just being with each other seemed to be all we needed. It's not that I have any hope we could ever recapture those initial feelings, but this is too far in the other direction. As I look over what I've just written, it sounds stupid. Why would you be interested in the complaints of a disgruntled forty-two-year-old woman? I feel stupid for even bothering you.</p><p>Anyway, here's the conclusion I've come to after wracking my brain for a year. And mind you, all I can really speak for are wives. I don't think I know that much about how my husband really feels or what he thinks about, and neither do the women I've discussed this with. If we had that kind of communication in the first place, we'd have much better marriages. When I ask them, most women say, "I'm happily married." And I say it, too. But what we are talking about is the whole picture: friends, family, children, grandchildren, and even the people we work with. What we don't talk about is happiness with our husbands.</p><p>So I'm not saying it's all bad. We have the status of being married, which is still important to most women, and my guess is to most men. It's certainly important to me. Marriage gives us more money, help with our children, and a man we can trust in a crisis, much more than we would have if we weren't married. And in so many marriages in our circle, our husbands are like Larry, good men whom we loved when we married them and for whom we still have some affection if no longer any passion.</p><p>I would also say that most women don't even want to face what I've written here. As I said, I'm almost afraid to send this to you: I dread that you'll tell me that what I have is as good as it's going to get. Tone down your expectations; the part of your life that you long for is over. You've got a good husband, make the best of it, you could be a lot worse off than you are.</p><p>Well, I've decided not to settle for what I have. I'm not going to settle for the marriage I have without trying to find out more than I know now. I'm sick of this being such a mystery-there must be things I can do. I'm also willing to put some effort into any suggestion you may give me that makes sense. Please, if you have anything to tell me, I'd like to hear from you.</p>Cheryl M.<p>Since Carleen and I had just completed the first six chapters of this book, Cheryl's letter couln't have been more timely. We quickly e-mailed our response. </p><p>We offered to send Cheryl the chapters but warned her that just reading them wouldn't solve her problems. Repairing a relationship isn't a simple "Do this" or "Don't do that" situation. It requires work and change, and it requires the willing participation of both partners.</p><p>We urged Cheryl to show Larry her e-mail and ours, and to get back to us if Larry was onboard. We also thanked her for giving us the subtitle to our book: <i>Solving the Mystery of Marriage. </i></p></p><h2>The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Geriatric Psychiatry (American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Geriatric Psychiatry)</h2><p>The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Geriatric Psychiatry is an indispensable resource for psychiatric clinicians and trainees charged with assessing, diagnosing, and treating mental disorders in our nation&#39;s burgeoning population of older adults, as well as the nurses and other professionals who provide critically important care day to day.

Practically all areas of life on this planet are constantly confronted with complex systems, be it ecosystems, societies, traffic, financial markets, opinion formation and spreading, or the internet and social media. Complex systems are systems composed of many elements that interact strongly with each other, which makes them extremely rich dynamical systems showing a huge range of phenomena. Properties of complex systems that are of particular importance are their efficiency, robustness, resilience, and proneness to collapse.<br><br>The quantitative tools and concepts needed to understand the co-evolutionary nature of networked systems and their properties are challenging. The book gives a self-contained introduction to these concepts, so that the reader will be equipped with a toolset that allows them to engage in the science of complex systems. Topics covered include random processes of path-dependent processes, co-evolutionary dynamics, dynamics of networks, the theory of scaling, and approaches from statistical mechanics and information theory. The book extends beyond the early classical literature in the field of complex systems and summarizes the methodological progress made over the past 20 years in a clear, structured, and comprehensive way.<br></p><p><br>Stefan Thurner, <em>Full Professor of Science of Complex Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Austria</em>, Peter Klimek, <em>Associate Professor, Medical University of Vienna, Austria</em>, Rudolf Hanel, <em>Associate Professor, Medical University of Vienna, Austria</em><br><br>Stefan Thurner is full professor for Science of Complex Systems at the Medical University of Vienna, where he chairs the Section for Science of Complex Systems.

Researchers use these statistical methods to examine the choices that consumers, households, firms, and other agents make. Each of the major models is covered: logit, generalized extreme value, or GEV (including nested and cross-nested logits), probit, and mixed logit, plus a variety of specifications that build on these basics. Simulation-assisted estimation procedures are investigated and compared, including maximum stimulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, and method of simulated scores. Procedures for drawing from densities are described, including variance reduction techniques such as anithetics and Halton draws. Recent advances in Bayesian procedures are explored, including the use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and its variant Gibbs sampling. The second edition adds chapters on endogeneity and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. No other book incorporates all these fields, which have arisen in the past 25 years. The procedures are applicable in many fields, including energy, transportation, environmental studies, health, labor, and marketing.</p><p>This book describes the new generation of discrete choice methods, focusing on the many advances that are made possible by simulation.

Written in a unique, lyrical Aramaic, this masterpiece of Kabbalah exceeds the dimensions of a normal book; it is virtually a body of literature, comprising over twenty discrete sections. The bulk of the <i>Zohar</i> consists of a running commentary on the Torah, from Genesis through Deuteronomy.</p> <p>This fourth volume of <i>The Zohar: Pritzker Edition</i> covers the first half of Exodus. Here we find mystical explorations of Pharaoh's enslavement of the Israelites, the birth of Moses, the deliverance from Egypt, the crossing of the Red Sea, and the Revelation at Mount Sinai. Throughout, the <i>Zohar</i> probes the biblical text and seeks deeper meaning&#x2015;for example, the nature of evil and its relation to the divine realm, the romance of Moses and <i>Shekhinah</i>, and the inner meaning of the Ten Commandments. In the context of the miraculous splitting of the Red Sea, Rabbi Shim'on reveals the mysterious Name of 72, a complex divine name consisting of 216 letters (72 triads), formed out of three verses in Exodus 14.</p> <p>These mystical interpretations are interwoven with tales of the Companions&#x2015;rabbis wandering through the hills of Galilee, sharing their insights, coming upon wisdom in the most astonishing ways from a colorful cast of characters they meet on the road.</p></p><p>Daniel C.

On March 6, 1857, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney delivered the Supreme Court's decision against Dred Scott, a slave who maintained he had been emancipated as a result of having lived with his master in the free state of Illinois and in federal territory where slavery was forbidden by the Missouri Compromise. The decision did much more than resolve the fate of an elderly black man and his family: <em>Dred Scott v. Sanford</em> was the first instance in which the Supreme Court invalidated a major piece of federal legislation. The decision declared that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery in the federal territories, thereby striking a severe blow at the legitimacy of the emerging Republican party and intensifying the sectional conflict over slavery. This book represents a skillful review of the issues before America on the eve of the Civil War. The first third of the book deals directly with the with the case itself and the Court's decision, while the remainder puts the legal and judicial question of slavery into the broadest possible American context. Fehrenbacher discusses the legal bases of slavery, the debate over the Constitution, and the dispute over slavery and continental expansion. He also considers the immediate and long-range consequences of the decision.<br></p><p><br>The late <strong>Don E.

Simple, direct, and delightfully unprincipled, this guide contains tales of global power mongering from every age and endeavors to show dilettante dictators and tyrants-to-be just how it's done. Tips are provided on creating a personal flag, what type of puppet government to establish, how to squelch free speech, and, most important, how to handle enemies. Also included are humorous full-color illustrations, sidebars on admirable despots, and self-quizzes that allow readers to see if they have what it takes to conquer the world.<br></p><p><b>Andr� de Guillaume</b> attended the Royal Military College at Sandhurst in England, where he learned to march with authority, tell people what to do, and appreciate fine wines. His attempted coup in the Cashman Islands was foiled, but his dictatorship tendencies remain untarnished.<br>This slim satirical volume purports to map the road to world (or at least great) power from childhood to the grave. Send-ups of everything abound, from pop psychology questionnaires such as "Have You Got What It Takes?" and lists of "Career Paths" (salesman being ideal, since it teaches how to lie with a straight face). After advising on how to seize power, by force or fraud, the tips then cover designing a national flag, managing money while gaining as little of it as possible honestly and arranging your love life so that it enhances your respectability. (This means that your wives and mistresses never meet.) There is even a guide for retirement, should one live so long. The historical snippets have much the same tone, although the portrayals of kids torturing animals to prepare for tyranny and the distinctly Third World flavor of the dictators may not strike everyone as funny. Others may more mildly object to bracketing Elizabeth I of England with Attila the Hun and the Bertelsmann conglomerate with the Mongols.

And amidst smoke, clamor, and terror, Jerusalem is falling to the Romans, its temple being destroyed. As Jews and Christians try to escape the city, we travel with some of them through an imagined week of flight and faith. A scribe makes his way into Galilee in search of records of Jesus' life and teachings. A company of women, responding to a prophecy, travels the route to a new life in Pella. We see friends reunited, join a worship gathering of Jesus followers, and discover treasured manuscripts. In this imaginative and entertaining narrative, New Testament scholar Ben Witherington leads us behind the veil of centuries to see and experience the historical and social realities of this epochal event. Allowing the light of what we do know to conjure possible events, <em>A Week in the Fall of Jerusalem</em> is a fun and informative journey into the wrinkles and folds of a lost story.</p><p>Ben Witherington III (PhD, University of Durham) is a prominent evangelical scholar and Jean R. Amos Professor of New Testament for Doctoral Studies at Asbury Theological Seminary. Witherington has written over forty books, including <em>The Jesus Quest</em> and <em>The Paul Quest,</em> both of which were selected as top biblical studies works by <em>Christianity Today.</em> His other works include <em>The Indelible Image</em>, <em>Women and the Genesis of Christianity</em>, <em>The Gospel Code</em>, <em>A Week in the Life of Corinth</em> and commentaries on the entire New Testament. He also writes for many church and scholarly publications and is a frequent contributor to <em>Patheos</em> and <em>Beliefnet</em>. Witherington is an elected member of the prestigious Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas, a society dedicated to New Testament studies. He is a John Wesley Fellow for Life, a research fellow at Cambridge University and a member of numerous professional organizations, including the Society of Biblical Literature, Society for the Study of the New Testament and the Institute for Biblical Research. He previously taught at institutions like Ashland Theological Seminary, Vanderbilt University, Duke Divinity School and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. An ordained pastor in the United Methodist Church and a popular lecturer, Witherington has presented seminars for churches, colleges and biblical meetings around the world. He has led numerous study tours through the lands of the Bible and is known for bringing the text to life through incisive historical and cultural analysis. Along with many interviews on radio and television networks across the country, Witherington has been seen in programs such as <em>60 Minutes</em>, <em>20/20</em>, <em>Dateline</em> and the Peter Jennings ABC special <em>Jesus and Paul&#x2015;The Word and the Witness</em>."With skill and drama, Ben Witherington takes us through what the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 might have been like&#x2015;fascinating, to say the least, and instructive as well." (Darrell Bock, senior research professor of New Testament studies, executive director for cultural engagement, The Hendricks Center, Dallas Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Three very important things happened in the first century AD: Jesus died on a Roman cross, Jesus was resurrected, and the city and temple of Jerusalem were captured and destroyed by the Romans. These three events, which took place within one generation, changed the world. The first two events have been discussed endlessly and have been dramatized in literature, theater, and cinema. But the third event, the fall of Jerusalem, has received very little attention. This is why I welcome Ben Witherington's imaginative but historically and culturally well-informed drama of what a week in the fall of Jerusalem might have been like. It's a fun read but also very informative and instructive." (Craig A. Evans, Houston Baptist University)<br><br>"Ben Witherington's <em>A Week in the Fall of Jerusalem</em> invites readers to imagine what life would have been like for Jewish believers in Yeshua in the turbulent days of the First Jewish Revolt, a gripping story with which many are unfamiliar. While telling a good story and weaving it around familiar characters of the New Testament, Witherington also informs readers about many historical and cultural elements of the Jewish and Roman worlds of the late first century. Witherington's narrative of historical fiction engages the reader's imagination, bringing them into an experience of the life of early Jewish Yeshua-followers in the wake of the trauma of AD 70."

And it is long overdue.<br><br>No individual who fought at Gettysburg was more controversial, both personally and professionally, than Major General Daniel E. Sickles. By 1863, Sickles was notorious as a disgraced former Congressman who murdered his wife&#x2019;s lover on the streets of Washington and used America&#x2019;s first temporary insanity defense to escape justice. With his political career in ruins, Sickles used his connections with President Lincoln to obtain a prominent command in the Army of the Potomac&#x2019;s Third Corps&#x2014;despite having no military experience. At Gettysburg, he openly disobeyed orders in one of the most controversial decisions in military history.<br><br>No single action dictated the battlefield strategies of George Meade and Robert E. Lee more than Sickles&#x2019; unauthorized advance to the Peach Orchard, and the mythic defense of Little Round Top might have occurred quite differently were it not for General Sickles. Fighting heroically, Sickles lost his leg on the field and thereafter worked to remove General Meade from command of the army. Sickles spent the remainder of his checkered life declaring himself the true hero of Gettysburg.<br><br>Although he nearly lost the battle, Sickles was one of the earliest guardians of the battlefield when he returned to Congress, created Gettysburg National Military Park, and helped preserve the field for future generations. But Dan Sickles was never far from scandal. He was eventually removed from the New York Monument Commission and nearly went to jail for misappropriation of funds.<br><br>Hessler&#x2019;s book is a balanced and entertaining account of Sickles&#x2019; colorful life. Civil War enthusiasts who want to understand General Sickles&#x2019; scandalous life, Gettysburg&#x2019;s battlefield strategies, the in-fighting within the Army of the Potomac, and the development of today&#x2019;s National Park will find Sickles at Gettysburg a must-read.<br><br>About the Author: James A.

Mathematicians largely agreed that it was impossible to predict the probability of an occurrence. Then, in 1654, Blaise Pascal wrote to Pierre de Fermat explaining that he had discovered how to calculate risk. The two collaborated to develop what is now known as probability theory&#x2014;a concept that allows us to think rationally about decisions and events.<p>In <i>The Unfinished Game</i>, Keith Devlin masterfully chronicles Pascal and Fermat's mathematical breakthrough, connecting a centuries-old discovery with its remarkable impact on the modern world.</p></p><p><b>Keith Devlin</b> is a Senior Researcher and Executive Director at Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and Information, a Consulting Professor in the Department of Mathematics, and a co-founder of the Stanford Media X research network.

The fact that what he articulates can be counted on to be accurate. <br> 3.

The technology, which is based on the ancient principles of charcoal production, flourished one hundred years ago until oil became cheap. In this book, energy engineer and UK gasification researcher Dr Andrew Rollinson explores the science, history, and potential of small-scale biomass gasifiers, along with providing detailed explanations on how to operate one successfully. For a readership which has to contend with dwindling fossil fuel reserves, increased energy prices, climate change, mountains of waste, and the modern version of a small-scale gasifier system, this book provides a helping hand. It will be relevant to those who want to assess whether the technology is right for them, but also serves as an operational guide for the gasifier operator, explaining what can go wrong, why, and how to achieve long-term operational success.

It is drawn with Guy Delisle's minimal line, interspersed with wordless vignettes and moments of his distinctive slapstick humor.</p></p><p><p><b>GUY DELISLE </b>spent a decade working in animation in Europe and Asia. In 2005&#x2013;2006, he accompanied his wife, an administrator for Doctors Without Borders, on a fourteen-month posting in Burma. He is currently working on a graphic novel about a year spent in Jerusalem.</p>DeLisle's (<i>Pyongyang</i>) latest exploration of Asian life is probably the best possible argument against the ruling junta in the embattled (and now nearly obliterated) nation also known as Myanmar. Readers will find themselves initially shocked and surprised at the country's differences, then awestruck by the new traditions and finally in love with and yet enraged by Burmese daily life. DeLisle's wife is a French aid worker with Medecins Sans Fronti�res (Doctors Without Borders), leaving DeLisle alone with their son, Louis, and his cartooning. DeLisle's style is simple but highly eloquent, and he tells more about the depth and breadth of the Burmese experience in the book's little nonfiction vignettes than he ever could in an artificially imposed narrative. <i>Burma Chronicles</i> is not merely a neat piece of cartooning but a valuable artifact of a repressive and highly destructive culture that curtails free speech with unparalleled tenacity. Like Joe Sacco's <i>The Fixer</i> and <i>Safe Area Gorazde</i>, DeLisle uses cartooning to dig into a story that demands to be told. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

If you buy only one book on the Vietnam War, this is the one you want." -<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br>Christian G. Appy's monumental oral history of the Vietnam War is the first work to probe the war's path through both the United States and Vietnam. These vivid testimonies of 135 men and women span the entire history of the Vietnam conflict, from its murky origins in the 1940s to the chaotic fall of Saigon in 1975. Sometimes detached and reflective, often raw and emotional, they allow us to see and feel what this war meant to people literally on all sides: Americans and Vietnamese, generals and grunts, policymakers and protesters, guerrillas and CIA operatives, pilots and doctors, artists and journalists, and a variety of ordinary citizens whose lives were swept up in a cataclysm that killed three million people. By turns harrowing, inspiring, and revelatory, <i>Patriots</i> is not a chronicle of facts and figures but a vivid human history of the war.<br><br>"A gem of a book, as informative and compulsively readable as it is timely." -<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>Christian Appy&#x2019;s <i>Patriots: The Vietnam War Remembered from All Sides</i> is an oral history that serves as a "final public record" from many who have struggled publicly with the war for 20 or 30 years. The book is also a monumental effort to capture voices long unheard and ensure that the words are not lost to a new generation. <p> </p><p> He includes statements from significant political and military figures from both sides of the conflict, including William Westmoreland, Alexander Haig, Nikita Kruschev's son Sergei, and Vice President Nguyen Thi Bihn. But he tempers these with the voices of a World Airways stewardess who accompanied troops out of the war zone, of the widow of the immolated Norman Morrison, and of numerous Vietnamese and American non-combatants whose lives were torn by the conflagration. These tales, and the contributions from poets, writers, and activists transform the book into a epic dialogue. Indeed, Appy says that he chose the title <i>Patriots</i> not out of a presumed understanding of how that word should be defined, but rather because it served as a locus for so many of the inner struggles of his interviewees: "In what ways might patriotism be a force for good or inspire noble sacrifice, and when does it become a club for stifling dissent and a rallying cry for unjustifiable destruction." </p><p> </p><p> <i>Patriots</i> is a book that will reawaken memories--horrific and jubilant--for those who lived through the troubled 1960s and 1970s; and for those just coming to understand the war, it will make vivid the trials of a different time and place. This is a lasting, powerful book that's essential reading for students of the Vietnam conflict. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p><b><b>Christian G.

In the greater part of Western Christianity, however, discomfort with images in worship, both statues and panel icons, has been a relatively common current, particularly since the Reformation. In the Roman Catholic Church, after years of using religious statues, the Second Vatican Council&#x2019;s call for &#x201c;noble simplicity&#x201d; in many cases led to a stripping of images that in some ways helped refocus attention on the eucharistic celebration itself but also led to a starkness that has left many Roman Catholics unsure of how to interact with the saints or with religious images at all.<br> Today, Western interest in panel icons has been rising, yet we lack standards of quality or catechesis on what to do with them. This book makes the case that icons should have a role to play in the Western Church that goes beyond mere decoration. Citing theological and ecumenical reasons, Visel argues that, with regard to use of icons, the post&#x2013;Vatican II Roman Catholic Church needs to give greater respect to the Eastern tradition. While Roman Catholics may never interact with icons in quite the same way that Eastern Christians do, we do need to come to terms with what icons are and how we should encounter them.</p><p>Jeana Visel, OSB, joined the Sisters of St. Benedict of Ferdinand, Indiana, in 2003. A northern Illinois native, she completed a BA in religious studies from Kenyon College and an MA in theology with a concentration in monastic studies from Saint John&#39;s School of Theology and Seminary. She is working on a DMin in spirituality from The Catholic University of America. She has been studying icon painting since 2006, completing workshops with master iconographer Xenia Pokrovsky and continuing studies with iconographer Marek Czarnecki. She works at Saint Meinrad Seminary and School of Theology."This intelligent study, noting everything from aesthetics and liturgical studies to theology, is an indispensable work for those who want to incorporate icons into Western worship and devotions. Grounded in solid scholarship and gracefully written, it is a most welcome volume on a quite timely topic."Lawrence S. Cunningham, The University of Notre Dame<br><br>"This lovely book by Sr. Jeana Visel offers a remarkably fresh approach to the sacred iconic art of the ancient Church and shows how it can be a spiritual resource to renew worship across the traditions: Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant. It wears its (significant) learning lightly. It takes the reader through a well-rounded history of iconography, and basing itself in the Western Christian tradition of response to that (for the West was always a little more wary of ascribing sacramental value to the icons) it shows how, although conflicted in some respects (such as wishing to restrict the role of religious art more to a didactic function), the Western iconic tradition has been wider and more nuanced than often presumed. The study has a very interesting set of theological reflections on the sacramentality of art following Vatican II. The conciliar call in the sixties for a `noble simplicity' to be introduced into church furnishing and liturgical fabric sometimes led to a crisis of banality in the artistic decoration of churches. Visel argues powerfully here that deep iconic art has the charisma to bring grace to contemporary worship, just as it did in times past, and can serve as an ecumenical <i>rapprochement</i>, with Catholicism's iconic tradition standing in a median role between the Orthodox and the Protestant worlds in their different understanding of icons as gateways to divine grace. Fifty years ago, icons (excepting Our Lady of Perpetual Succour) were hardly ever seen in the Catholic Church. Now they are a dominant form of spiritual expression. They have begun to make a more familiar appearance in many of the Reformed churches too. It has been a remarkable, unplanned, ecumenical outreach from the East, partly initiated by an unlikely evangelist, Stalin, selling off his Russian Church's great treasures to fund his machine of oppression. These quiet exiles brought their grace to the West once more and whispered a word of ecumenical grace and peace. Visel's book continues that `secret ministry.' The text has been produced by Liturgical Press with a deep artistic sensibility: its numerous illustrations make it a beautiful thing to possess. A little treasure. Highly recommended."Archpriest John A. McGuckin, Nielsen Professor of Byzantine Christian History, Columbia University, New York<br><br>"Sr. Jeana Visel has done us a great service in her book. She writes with great lucidity, sensitivity, and learning about the need for the Western Church to embrace icons as part of its patrimony. After outlining the historical and theological background of the icon, she boldly and intelligently addresses the contemporary challenges facing the icon's integration into the Western Church. A book for all Roman Catholic laypeople, and of great interest to Orthodox readers also, at the very least it should be mandatory reading for every Catholic seminarian, priest, and church architect."Aidan Hart, British Iconographer and Writer<br><br>"For any reader unfamiliar with icons or the Roman Catholic perspective on icons this text provides a succinct, well-written overview of these topics. This text is an original work that would be well-situated for students of art history, iconography, or Orthodox-Catholic ecumenism."Walter N. Sisto,&nbsp;<i>Catholic Books Review</i><br><br>"<i>Icons in the Western Church</i>&nbsp;is a fascinating, helpful book for anyone who admires icons yet lacks an in-depth understanding of their background and purpose. Well-researched and clearly written, this work will help the reader sort through the theological, liturgical, and ethical issues involved in the use of icons in the Western Church. In this timely, ecumenically sensitive, and thought-provoking book, the author provides nuanced suggestions concerning the placement of icons in churches and homes of the faithful and also challenges the practice of some artists in creating `new' icons."Rita Ferrone, Editor of&nbsp;<i>The Yale ISM Review</i><br><br>"Just as the words of Scripture have been carefully transmitted to us down through the ages, the icon likewise embodies our faith in wood and paint and shimmering gold. Jeana Visel gives us a well-grounded and insightful way to think about this traditional art form in new ways and its possible integration into Western worship. Visel's approach is enriched by the personal experience of being an accomplished icon writer herself. This book is a must for all who are interested in the integration of liturgy and the arts."Martin Erspamer, OSB, Saint Meinrad Archabbey<br><br>"Jeana Visel provides those who are interested in studying the aesthetics in the worship space an indispensable liturgical study of icons or panel paintings.

Despite the implacable hostility of the Church of God Awaiting, Charis still stands, still free, still tolerant, still an island of innovation in a world in which the Church has worked for centuries to keep humanity locked at a medieval level of existence.</p><p>But the powerful men who run the Church aren't going to take their defeat lying down. Charis may control the world's seas, but it barely has an army worthy of the name. And as King Cayleb knows, far too much of the kingdom's recent good fortune is due to the secret manipulations of the being that calls himself Merlin-a being that, the world must not find out too soon, is more than human. A being on whose shoulders rests the last chance for humanity's freedom.</p><p>Now, as Charis and its archbishop make the rift with Mother Church explicit, the storm gathers. Schism has come to the world of Safehold.

The twin-masted courier ship flying that wind-starched banner as she scudded along on the brisk breeze was little more than seventy feet long, built for speed rather than endurance . . . or even seakeeping and stability. Her crew of sixty was small for any galley, even one as diminutive as she was, but her slender, lightly constructed hull was well suited for rowing, and her lateen sails drove her in a rapid flurry of foam as she went slicing across the brilliant sun-splintered water and foaming white horses of the thirty-mile-wide passage between Callie&#x2019;s Island and the northeastern shore of Eraystor Bay.<br>Father Rahss Sawal, the small fleet vessel&#x2019;s commander, stood on his tiny quarterdeck, hands clasped behind him, and concentrated on looking confident while he gazed up at the seabirds and wyverns hovering against the painfully blue sky. It was harder than it ought to have been to maintain the outward assurance (it would never have done to call it arrogance) proper to the master of one of Mother Church&#x2019;s couriers, and Sawal didn&#x2019;t much care for the reason he found it so.<br>The Temple&#x2019;s messengers, whether landbound or afloat, enjoyed absolute priority and freedom of passage. They carried God&#x2019;s own messages and commands, with all the authority of the archangels themselves, and no mortal had the temerity to challenge their passage wherever God or His Church might send them. That had been true literally since the Creation, and no one had ever dared to dispute it. Unfortunately, Sawal was no longer certain the centuries-old inviolability of Mother Church&#x2019;s messengers continued to hold true.<br>The thought was . . . disturbing, in more ways than one. Most immediately, because of the potential consequences for his own current mission. In the long run, because the failure of that inviolability was unthinkable. Defiance of the authority of God&#x2019;s Church could have only one consequence for the souls of the defiers, and if their example led others into the same sin . . . <br>Sawal pushed that thought aside once more, telling himself&#x2014;insisting to himself&#x2014;that whatever madness had infected the Kingdom of Charis, God would never permit it to spread beyond Charis&#x2019; borders. The universal authority of Mother Church was the linchpin not simply of the world in which he lived, but of God&#x2019;s very plan for Man&#x2019;s salvation. If that authority were challenged, if it failed, the consequences would be unthinkable. Shanwei, lost and damned mother of evil, must be licking her fangs at the very possibility in the dark, dank corner of Hell to which the Archangel Langhorne had consigned her for her sins. Even now she must be testing the bars, trying the strength of her chains, as she tasted the overweening, sinful pride of those who sought to set their own fallible judgment in place of God&#x2019;s. Langhorne himself had locked that gate behind her, with all the authority of eternity, but Man had free will. Even now, he could turn the key in that lock if he so chose, and if he did . . .<br>Damn those Charisians, he thought grimly. Don&#x2019;t they even realize what door they&#x2019;re opening? Don&#x2019;t they care? Don&#x2019;t&#x2014;<br>His jaw tightened and he forced himself to relax his shoulders and draw a deep, cleansing breath. It didn&#x2019;t help very much.<br>His instructions from Bishop Executor Thomys had been abundantly clear. Sawal was to deliver the bishop executor&#x2019;s dispatches to Bishop Executor Wyllys in Eraystor at all costs. That phrase&#x2014;&#x201c;at all costs&#x201d;&#x2014;had never before been part of Sawal&#x2019;s orders. There&#x2019;d never been any need for it, but there was now, and&#x2014;<br>&#x201c;Deck there!&#x201d; The shout came down from the crow&#x2019;s nest. &#x201c;Deck there! Three sail on the port bow!&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; Commander Paitryk Hywyt, Royal Charisian Navy, murmured to himself as he peered through the spyglass. &#x201c;This should be interesting.&#x201d;<br>He lowered the glass and frowned thoughtfully. His orders were perfectly clear on this point. They&#x2019;d made him more than a little nervous when he first received them, but they were definitely clear, and now he discovered that he was actually looking forward to obeying them. Odd. He wouldn&#x2019;t have thought that was likely to happen.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Church courier, all right,&#x201d; he said a bit louder, and Zhak Urvyn, HMS Wave&#x2019;s first lieutenant, made a distinctly unhappy sound.<br>&#x201c;Some of the men may not like it, Sir,&#x201d; Urvyn said softly. Hywyt glanced sideways at him, then shrugged.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a feeling the men&#x2019;s attitude may just surprise you a bit, Zhak,&#x201d; he said dryly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re still about as pissed off as I&#x2019;ve ever seen them, and they know who that courier&#x2019;s really working for this morning.&#x201d; <br>Urvyn nodded, but he looked gloomier than ever, and Hywyt grimaced mentally. It wasn&#x2019;t the men Urvyn expected to be unhappy; it was Urvyn himself.<br>&#x201c;Bring her three points to port, if you please, Lieutenant,&#x201d; Hywyt said, speaking rather more formally than was his wont. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s lay out a course to intercept her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aye, aye, Sir.&#x201d; Urvyn&#x2019;s expression was worried, but he saluted and passed the order to the helmsman while other hands pattered across the wooden decks to tend sheets and braces.<br>Wave changed course, slicing across the water close-hauled on the port tack, and Hywyt felt a familiar surge of pleasure as his vessel responded. The sleek, flush-decked, twin-masted schooner was just over ninety-five feet long on the waterline, and mounted fourteen thirty-pounder carronades. Unlike some of her sisters, Wave had been designed and built from the keel up as a light cruiser for the Royal Charisian Navy. Her revolutionary sail plan made her faster and far more weatherly than any other ship Hywyt had ever encountered, far less commanded, and she&#x2019;d already taken no less than seven prizes&#x2014;almost half of those captured by the entire blockading squadron&#x2014;here in Emeraldian waters since the Battle of Darcos Sound. That was what speed and handiness meant, and the comfortable sound prize money made falling into their purses had helped overcome any lingering qualms his crew might have cherished. They were Charisians, after all, he thought with a gleam of humor. Charis&#x2019; numerous detractors were wont to refer to the Kingdom as a &#x201c;kingdom of shopkeepers and moneylenders,&#x201d; and not in tones of approval. Hywyt had listened to their rancorous envy for years, and he had to admit there was at least a little truth to the stereotype of the Charisian constantly on the prowl for ways to make a quick mark.<br>Of course, we&#x2019;re also very good at it, aren&#x2019;t we? he reflected, and felt himself smiling as the courier boat with the dark green flag drew rapidly nearer.<br>He couldn&#x2019;t be positive the other ship had come from Corisande, but no other explanation seemed very likely. The dispatch boat had obviously approached through Dolphin Reach, which certainly meant it had also crossed the Sea of Zebediah. No courier from Haven or Howard would have been coming from that direction, and Hywyt rather doubted Sharleyan of Chisholm was particularly interested in corresponding with Nahrmahn of Emerald at the moment. And judging from the way the fellow had chosen the strait between Callie&#x2019;s Island and the Emeraldian coast, he definitely didn&#x2019;t want to attract the attention of the blockade squadron.<br>Unfortunately for him, he already had, and it was evident that his ship, for all its sleek design, was quite a bit slower than Wave under these conditions. <br>&#x201c;Clear for action,&#x201d; he said, and watched the gap between the two ships narrow as the drum began to beat.&nbsp;Rahss Sawal tried very hard not to swear as the Charisian schooner swept towards him. Obviously, his information was even more out-of-date than he&#x2019;d feared when Bishop Executor Thomys gave him his orders. He hadn&#x2019;t expected to see Charisian warships actually inside Eraystor Bay proper. Then again, he hadn&#x2019;t expected to see the gold kraken on black of the Charisian flag flying above what used to be the Emeraldian fortress on Callie&#x2019;s Island, either.<br>The dispersal of the Charisian warships was the clearest possible evidence of the totality of their victory at the Battle of Darcos Sound. The true extent of the allied fleet&#x2019;s defeat had still been unclear when Sawal left Manchyr. That it had been crushing was obvious, but everyone in Corisande had clung to the hope that the majority of the ships which had not returned had found refuge in Emerald, where they were even then helping Nahrmahn defend their anchorage.<br>Obviously not, Sawal thought sourly.<br>He could see exactly four ships now, counting the schooner charging down on his own command, and every one of them flew Charisian colors. They were spread out widely, as well, to cover as much of the bay as they could, and they wouldn&#x2019;t have been doing that if there&#x2019;d been any possibility at all that someone might consider attacking them. That, coupled with the fact that all the island fortifications Sawal could see from his quarterdeck had clearly become Charisian bases, not Emeraldian ones, made it abundantly clear that there was no &#x201c;allied fleet&#x201d; any longer, much less one that was still defending its anchorage.<br>Sawal had never before encountered one of the Charisians&#x2019; new schooners, and he was astonished at how close to t...</p><h2>Fast Track to Sailing: Learn to Sail in Three Days</h2><p><p><b>The learn-to-sail book for when you are in a hurry to gain your sea legs</b></p> <p>At the Offshore Sailing School, the Colgates have taught more than 100,000 adults how to sail.

He picked tiny notes off the strings until they fluttered, snapping in the air. The singer turned his head, caught the tune, the title flashing up: sure, &#x201c;Strange Things Happening Every Day,&#x201d; Sister Rosetta Tharpe, when was it, 1945? Closing in on Tharpe&#x2019;s own guitar line, the guitarist felt for the syncopation in the rhythm, and the song came to life in the singer&#x2019;s mind.<br>On that last great Judgment Day<br>When they drive them all away<br>There are strange things happening every day<br>She was shameless, the singer remembered: purer than pure when her mother was alive, backsliding after that. She came onto the Lord&#x2019;s stage in a mink; she had a way with a guitar few men could touch. She was the black church in the Grand Ole Opry&#x2014;she&#x2019;d even recorded with Pat Boone&#x2019;s father-in-law, Red Foley, Mr. &#x201c;Old Shep&#x201d; himself. On the other hand, Red Foley had recorded &#x201c;Peace in the Valley,&#x201d; hadn&#x2019;t he, the spiritual the Reverend Thomas A. Dorsey had written as the Second World War began? The sainted gospel composer, in earlier days known as Georgia Tom, who&#x2019;d put his name on dirty blues? The singer shook his head: why was he remembering all this? His memory raced ahead of him. For some reason he remembered that &#x201c;Strange Things Happening&#x201d; had topped the black charts the same week Hitler killed himself. It was April 30, 1945; the singer was a month short of four, Sister Rosetta Tharpe was thirty. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something in the gospel blues,&#x201d; she would say years later, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s so deep the world can&#x2019;t stand it.&#x201d; Now he heard the song as if the war had ended yesterday, as if it were the first time he&#x2019;d heard it, wherever that had been&#x2014;off some road he&#x2019;d never remember anything else about, like waking from a dream you had to get up and live through.<br>If you want to view the crime<br>You must learn to quit your lyin&#x2019;<br>There are strange things happening every day<br>The guitarist was beginning to mumble the words, faking them, getting only the title phrase.

It was May 26, 1966; for two weeks he&#x2019;d been up and down England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales. Two days before he&#x2019;d crossed the English Channel to celebrate his birthday onstage in Paris, dropping a huge American flag as the curtains opened for the second set, the crowd going mad with rage as if he were throwing America&#x2019;s war in Vietnam in their faces&#x2014;come on, hadn&#x2019;t they started it?&#x2014;then taking in the headline in&nbsp;<i>Le Figaro</i>&nbsp;the next day: &#x201c;LA CHUTE D&#x2019;UNE IDOLE.&#x201d; It was kind of a quiet night, actually, compared to&nbsp;... he&#x2019;d been in control. It wasn&#x2019;t usually like that, not this month, when the whole previous year felt like it was packed into a bomb that wouldn&#x2019;t stop exploding. Most nights abuse came raining down as if he could bring the weather with him, as if hate were the wind at his back, the storm waiting in every next town.<br>He walked out of his dressing room. He knew that when he sang his folk songs&#x2014;most of them no more folk songs than a Maytag washing machine, except unlike a Maytag washing machine they didn&#x2019;t rely on electricity&#x2014;a few older numbers, to please the crowd, or tease it, but mainly those long, odd songs that no longer made anyone laugh, &#x201c;Visions of Johanna,&#x201d; &#x201c;Mr. Tambourine Man,&#x201d; &#x201c;Desolation Row,&#x201d; when he stood still, picked strings, and appeared as any singer might have appeared in the years or centuries before him, the people in the audience would show respect, even approval. He knew that when he finished that set, left, and came back with the Hawks&#x2014;the piano player on one side of the stage, the organist on the other, the bass player and the guitarist at his sides, the drummer on a riser behind them&#x2014;the trouble would start; the problem was, he never knew just when it would start. &#x201c;How do you get your kicks these days?&#x201d; an interviewer asked him a few months before. &#x201c;I hire people to look into my eyes, and then I have them kick me,&#x201d; Dylan said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how you get your kicks?&#x201d; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Dylan said, &#x201c;then I&nbsp;<i>forgive</i>&nbsp;them. That&#x2019;s where my kicks come in.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t that easy, though; once the second set began, it was as if the two sides&#x2014;the six on the stage, those in the crowd who had set themselves against them&#x2014;were trying most of all to drown each other out.<br>&#x201c;Dylan questions the comparisons drawn between charity rock events like Live Aid and USA for Africa and the student activism of yesteryear,&#x201d; a reporter wrote in 1985, then let Dylan speak: &#x201c;The big difference between now and the sixties is that then it was much more dangerous to do that sort of thing. There were people trying to stop the show any way they could&nbsp;... Then, you didn&#x2019;t know which end the trouble was coming from. And it could come at any time.&#x201d; He could have been talking about politics, in the narrow sense that the reporter was framing the issue; he could have been talking about the kind of politics that in 1966 occurred whenever he opened his mouth. And it was so stupid. Almost every night, the music lifted off the stage, so strong it was like a body, and there were moments when he couldn&#x2019;t believe he couldn&#x2019;t take his hand off his Fender Stratocaster and touch it. It was hard to hear, and hard to believe anything could ever be better. And then, at just that instant when the timing between a group of musicians was life itself, when the smallest mistake, the mistake you knew could never happen, would throw the world off its axis, when a physics no scientist would ever understand was all there was, the shouting would start, as if the audience that understood nothing understood one thing: ambush. A note, a chord, the start of a rhythm, and, then, &#x201c;COCKSUCKER.&#x201d;<br>On May 26, 1966, at the Royal Albert Hall, they were just about to move into &#x201c;Leopard-skin Pill-box Hat&#x201d;&#x2014;a yet-to-be-released&nbsp;<i>Blonde on Blonde</i>&nbsp;tune that after a month or so on the road had turned into a big, noisy, vulgar Chicago blues carrying hilariously sneering lyrics (&#x201c;I saw you making love with him / You forgot to close the garage door&#x201d;)&#x2014;when it started. The tape that survives from this night doesn&#x2019;t register the crowd; you can&#x2019;t hear what Bob Dylan is hearing, but by now his senses are strung so tightly any discord is painful, and even as you might imagine him standing straight to face the crowd, three decades later you can hear him sag. &#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; he says, like someone who has seen this too many times; the good lines that took him out of the dressing room, that great beat, are out of reach. The one shout he&#x2019;d caught from the crowd is already growing, the once-timid now screaming: TRAITOR. SELLOUT. MOTHERFUCKER. YOU&#x2019;RE NOT BOB DYLAN. And then laughter. &#x201c;Are you talking to me?&#x201d; Dylan says, theatrically; you can feel him strike a pose. There are more shouts; you can&#x2019;t decipher them, but he can. &#x201c;Come up here and say that,&#x201d; he says, and the great hall falls away. It is gone. We&#x2019;re in a bar in a town whose name you didn&#x2019;t catch when you drove in and won&#x2019;t remember to notice when you drive out, and in this bar &#x201c;Ballad of a Thin Man&#x201d; is all that is left.<br>In the fall of 1965, as the last song on the first side of the just-issued&nbsp;<i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>, the performance was almost laconic. Dylan&#x2019;s hipster piano, all reverb and menacing languor, led a high, ghostly organ sound, but mostly the music communicated distance, cool, disregard. There was more of the Midwest in Dylan&#x2019;s voice than in anything else on the disc&#x2014;more dust. The singer has seen it all before. You can&#x2019;t surprise him. Bearing down just slightly for the chorus, repeated again and again without change&#x2014;&#x201c;You know something is happening, but you don&#x2019;t know what it is&#x201d;&#x2014;on record Dylan found an instant catchphrase for the moral, generational, and racial divisions that in this moment found Americans defining themselves not as who they were but as who they were not, and he also found a commercial hook.&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;You know something&#x2019;s happening, but you&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;you could hear it everywhere over the next months, out of anyone&#x2019;s mouth. By definition, if you knew the song, you knew what was happening. If you wanted to know what was happening, or appear as if you did, you had to buy the album. Before the year was out,&nbsp;<i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>&nbsp;was only two places short of the top of the charts.<br>But on this tour, in May of 1966, up and down the British Isles, it is not this &#x201c;Ballad of a Thin Man&#x201d; that raises the bar it finds you in. Now it has become the most bitter, unstable song; with Dylan turning to the piano for this single number, it is also the song that is somehow most alive to the particular ambience of any given night, the weather, the frame of the hall, the mood of the crowd, sucking it up and using it like a karate fighter turning an opponent&#x2019;s strength against him. Some tunes in the set Dylan offers with the Hawks&#x2014;&#x201c;Tell Me, Momma,&#x201d; &#x201c;Baby Let Me Follow You Down,&#x201d; &#x201c;One Too Many Mornings,&#x201d; &#x201c;I Don&#x2019;t Believe You&#x201d;&#x2014;fly or they don&#x2019;t, but formally they are always the same. &#x201c;Ballad of a Thin Man&#x201d; is always different, always changed by the crowd, then moving as if to change it in turn.<br>The song begins and ends with the oldest, corniest beatnik clich�: the square. Some poor sap, well dressed, well heeled. As a listener, in the crowd, you&#x2019;re set up to imagine him as whoever you&#x2019;re not. The song puts him through the wringer. Always at home in the streets of his town, he is now trapped in a demimonde, in an after-hours club where he is neither welcome nor permitted to leave. He&#x2019;s heard about the kind of people who inhabit these places: drug addicts, homosexuals, Negroes, intellectuals, homosexual Negro intellectuals like the funny-looking man with the beret and the popeyes. The square has seen the man&#x2019;s picture in the papers; he&#x2019;s even seen his like, men and women, black and white, in the streets. They used to live in the shadows; now they appear in public, as if the town is theirs.<br>The square watches as a man in high heels kneels at his feet and smiles up at him like a snake. He&#x2019;s taken into a room where everyone is shouting slogans, the kind of slogans the square has seen on the protest placards people carry on their marches, but here the slogans are in a different language, if it is a language at all: &#x201c;NOW,&#x201d; they say blankly; &#x201c;YOU&#x2019;RE A COW.&#x201d; The square wants to run but he doesn&#x2019;t even know where he is&#x2014;and by now whoever is listening is beginning to recognize his or her own dim shape in the song. Whoever is listening is beginning to flinch.<br>The walls of the Albert Hall rise up again, the noise from the crowd stays constant, but seated at the piano Dylan starts the music. The song is a blues, no more, on some nights the biggest blues anyone has ever heard, with Garth Hudson&#x2019;s organ finding a mode so mocking it is sadistic, a whirlpool opening and then laughing at your fear as it closes, with Robbie Robertson&#x2019;s first guitar notes enormous, Godzilla notes, so big they throw the audience back, daring anyone to say the first word&#x2014;but not this night.<br>On this night, the last night but one of these weeks in the United Kingdom, the last time but one this music would ever be played, no one is thrown back. Instead wounds are exposed, and the ugly sight quiets the crowd. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Dylan asks Robbie Robertson, just three weeks past twenty-two; Bob Dylan is an old man, twenty-five years and two days. The crowd can&#x2019;t hear the singer whispering to the man at his side as if he&#x2019;s never been less sure of anything, but they can feel the way he&#x2019;s hovering, or tottering, and the sight is a kind of violence, a terror, a negative, a nothing.<br>Here it is: nothing. Here you are, all of you. It will take four thousand holes to fill the Albert Hall, and four thousand times nothing is nothing.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Even as recorded on&nbsp;<i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>, the songs Bob Dylan began offering in 1965, most with rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll accompaniment rattling and grand, took shape as treasure maps, and the treasure toward which they pointed was a still-undiscovered sound. By the spring of 1966 the songs had become the treasure. The tale of how this transformation came about is inseparable from the tale of how the music was received. In 1965 and 1966 Bob Dylan&#x2019;s music made a social drama, a drama that resisted all the charms of resolution.<br>It began at the Newport Folk Festival without any plan. On June 16, in New York City, Dylan had recorded &#x201c;Like a Rolling Stone&#x201d; with a band that included New Yorker Al Kooper on organ and Chicagoan Mike Bloomfield, of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, on lead guitar; meeting up with the two in Rhode Island on July 24, the day &#x201c;Like a Rolling Stone&#x201d; went into the charts, the notion of a festival surprise seemed irresistible. Electric music had never been played at Newport, but the Butterfield band was itself set for a blues workshop; the equipment was there. Completing a pickup band with pianist Barry Goldberg, plus Butterfield&#x2019;s drummer Sam Lay and his bassist Jerome Arnold, Dylan rehearsed through the night and showed up the next day, on Newport&#x2019;s main stage, ready to experiment. Pete Seeger, the paragon of the folk revival, the man who represented all of its compassion and nobility, who as the son of the revered folk scholar Charles Seeger embodied a whole, people&#x2019;s enactment of an American folk century, had begun the evening by playing a recording of the cry of a newborn baby. He asked that everyone in the audience sing to the baby, that they tell it into what sort of world it had been born&#x2014;and &#x201c;he already knew,&#x201d; wrote Jim Rooney, a mainstay of the folk scene in Cambridge, Massachusetts, &#x201c;what he wanted others to sing. They were going to sing that it was a world of pollution, bombs, hunger, and injustice, but that PEOPLE would OVERCOME.&#x201d; That was the call. Then Bob Dylan took his turn.<br>Watching the film of this night, one can see eager young men&#x2014;Dylan and Mike Bloomfield in particular&#x2014;taking their cues straight from&nbsp;<i>High Noon</i>, or the one-on-one shootouts that throughout their teenage years opened and closed almost every episode of&nbsp;<i>Gunsmoke.</i>&nbsp;Cheers greeted a simpering introduction by Peter Yarrow of the folk trio Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, which two years before had made Dylan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Blowin&#x2019; in the Wind&#x201d; a huge national hit and a touchstone of the era&#x2014;&#x201c;The person who&#x2019;s coming up now, is a person who has, in a sense, changed the face of folk music, to the&nbsp;<i>large American public</i>, because he has brought to it, the point of view of a&nbsp;<i>poet</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;but as the band took the stage and commenced tuning up the crowd was quiet.<br>Dylan&#x2019;s cry of &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; is like a leap out of a plane. He leans back on his bootheels, as if daring gravity, an erotic nimbus of certainty and pleasure around his face. Bloomfield crouches low, holding his guitar as a rifle with bayonet fixed, lunging for the sound with crackling noise every time Dylan takes a breath. Dylan is shouting out the caustic black humor of &#x201c;Maggie&#x2019;s Farm&#x201d; without range, without any need for it, as if he&#x2019;s just discovered that as a singer he can stomp his foot through the boards.

He has been a pop star with his bands Brinsley Schwarz and Rockpile, a stepson-in-law to Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, and is the writer behind hits including "Cruel to Be Kind" and "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding." In the past decades, however, he has distinguished himself as an artist who is equally acclaimed for the second act of his career as a tender yet sharp-tongued acoustic balladeer.<br><br> Biographer Will Birch, who in addition to being a music writer was a drummer and songwriter with The Records, has known Lowe for over forty years and melds Lowe's gift as a witty raconteur with his own authoritative analysis of Lowe's background and the cultural scenes he exemplifies. Lowe's parallel fame as one of the best interviews in the business will contribute to this first look into his life and work--and likely the closest thing fans will get to an autobiography by this notoriously charming cult figure.<br>This is not an authorized biography, but Lowe has given it his spiritual blessing and his management and label are fully on board.<i> Cruel to Be Kind</i> will be the colorful yet serious account of one of the world's most talented and admired musicians.</p><p><b>Will Birch</b> is a former drummer and songwriter with the Kursaal Flyers ("Little Does She Know") and The Records ("Starry Eyes"). During the 1980s he moved into record production, working with such acts as Any Trouble, Dr Feelgood, Hollies, Billy Bremner (Rockpile) and the Long Ryders. Throughout the 1990s Will wrote many articles for <i>MOJO </i>and other music magazines. He is the author of <i>No Sleep Till Canvey Island: The Great Pub Rock Revolution</i>, and <i>Ian Dury: The Definitive Biography</i>. He lives near London."[An] entertaining biography... [Birch] is casually expert in the way of those rare music writers who can both play music and write."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></i></b><br><br>"[<i>Cruel to Be Kind</i>] makes clear that Lowe's contributions to pop music have been many and mighty--and certainly worthy of celebration with a biography...sure to please old-time admirers of an essential rocker."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></i></b><br><br>"In leisurely, insightful prose...Will Birch offers a solid biography for Lowe's devoted fans."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"[Will Birch] has written a sunny book about the genial and underappreciated Lowe, following his career through its many incarnations... [A]n enjoyable portrait."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist</i></i></b><br><br>"Even the Jesus of Cool needs a St. Paul to spread his gospel and Will Birch is more than up to the task in <i>Cruel to Be Kind</i>. In this intimate, engrossing, and eye-opening biography of Nick Lowe, Birch reveals deep insights into the man and his work. It's a book as elegant as one of Lowe's songs: filled with just the right combination of pathos, humor, and wit, told with an economy of style, and nary a wasted word or sentence.

It&#x2019;s what if? Fiction isn&#x2019;t real life with the names changed. It&#x2019;s an alternate reality to reflect the reader&#x2019;s own world.</p><p>But what is a short story not? It&#x2019;s not a condensation of a novel, or an unfinished one. It&#x2019;s not Cliffs Notes to anything. It has its own shape and profile. It&#x2019;s not the New York skyline; it&#x2019;s a single church spire. Its end is much nearer its beginning, and so it can be overlooked.</p><p>The short story is much misunderstood. There are even aspiring writers who think they&#x2019;ll start out writing short stories and work their way up to the big time: novels. It doesn&#x2019;t work like that. A short story isn&#x2019;t easier than a novel. It has so little space to make its mark that it requires the kind of self-mutilating editing most new writers aren&#x2019;t capable of.

Even in a handful of pages, the characters can&#x2019;t be the same people in the last paragraph whom we met in the first. If there&#x2019;s no change, there&#x2019;s no story, unless you write fiction for <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine.</p><p>A word writers use is &#x201c;epiphany.&#x201d; In ancient Greece the word described the miraculous appearance of a god or goddess. The Christian church uses the word with a capital <i>E</i> to define Twelfth Night, the moment when the Magi, the Three Kings, made the long-heralded discovery of the Christ child.</p><p>In fiction writing, the epiphany is a sudden breakthrough of understanding, of self-awareness. It&#x2019;s that moment of change that changes every moment after. It&#x2019;s the lightbulb switched suddenly on over somebody&#x2019;s head. Novels tell of epiphanies acted upon. A short story tends to turn upon a single epiphany, sometimes in the last line. The change to come is to play out in the reader&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>In real life we have epiphanies all the time. But we wait for them to go away. Change is too hard, and threatening. That&#x2019;s why we have fiction. Stories are better than real life, or we wouldn&#x2019;t have them. Stories for the young present the metaphor of change upon the page to prepare the readers for the changes coming in their lives. Non-readers will never be ready.</p><p>Again, like all fiction, a short story is never an answer, always a question. Writers with answers write nonfiction: advice columns and government pamphlets and textbooks. Fiction writers have only questions, and the eternal question all fiction asks the reader is:</p><p>WHAT IF I WERE THE CHARACTER IN THIS STORY? WHAT WOULD I DO?</p><p>This is the great gift readers receive: They can be anybody and go anywhere. They can try on all these lives to see which ones fit.</p><p>Stories raise every kind of question. Stories for the young regularly invite their readers to ask themselves:</p><p>WHEN WILL I START TAKING CHARGE OF MY LIFE?</p><p>A comic story can ask serious questions. So can a tale of the supernatural, which is only another device for questioning actual people and wondering how they work. A story set in past times can ask a modern reader timeless questions about all those issues history and progress never solve. Even an animal character can be a way of asking what moves and motivates humans. Fiction writers creep up on as many sides of their readers as they can. They use as many techniques as they can think of.</p><p>And so a short story is like all fiction: It&#x2019;s a question about change.</p><p>All stories begin with those same two words:</p><p>WHAT IF?</p><p>A story isn&#x2019;t what is. It&#x2019;s what if? Fiction isn&#x2019;t real life with the names changed. It&#x2019;s an alternate reality to reflect the reader&#x2019;s own world.</p><p>But what is a short story not? It&#x2019;s not a condensation of a novel, or an unfinished one. It&#x2019;s not Cliffs Notes to anything. It has its own shape and profile. It&#x2019;s not the New York skyline; it&#x2019;s a single church spire. Its end is much nearer its beginning, and so it can be overlooked.</p><p>&#x201c;One tends to overpraise a long book because one has got through it,&#x201d; said E. M. Forster&#x2014;a novelist. His tongue was in his cheek, but he makes a point. A full-length novel with its community of characters, its multiple epiphanies, its changing scenes, is taken more seriously&#x2014;in class, in reviews, in the book club.</p><p>The short story is much misunderstood. There are even aspiring writers who think they&#x2019;ll start out writing short stories and work their way up to the big time: novels. It doesn&#x2019;t work like that. A short story isn&#x2019;t easier than a novel. It has so little space to make its mark that it requires the kind of self-mutilating editing most new writers aren&#x2019;t capable of. It has less time to plead its case.</p><p>Only poetry is less forgiving. But poetry can teach you how to throw out all the words that aren&#x2019;t pulling their weight. In a short story there&#x2019;s no place to hide, whether you&#x2019;re the writer or the reader.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t meant to be a short-story writer. I&#x2019;d hoped to be Mark Twain. The first of his books to lift me out of my world and into a bigger one was <i>Life on the Mississippi.</i></p><p>It seemed to be autobiography, and true. I little knew how much fictional technique, and fiction, that book embodied. I fell for nonfiction, the romance of the real.</p><p>But later when I was a teacher, an English teacher naturally, my students preferred fiction to reality. They were in junior high, and so they preferred ANYTHING to reality. But our curriculum was heavy-laden with full-length novels, even when I drew up the reading list myself. I harbored the wan hope of stretching their attention spans.</p><p>Junior-high teaching made a writer out of me. The first question a writer has to answer before putting pen to paper is:</p><p>WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE WILLING TO READ WHAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO WRITE?</p><p>I found those people in my roll book. They were the people I knew the best, and liked the best. From our first morning together I knew things about them their parents dared never know. Better yet, as their English teacher I saw in their compositions what they would never say aloud within the hearing of their powerful peers. The voices in their pages still ring in mine.</p><p>When I quit teaching to write, I had novels in mind. First one, to see if I could do it, and now thirty-two novels through these thirty-two years later. But as the years went by, the short story found its own way into my career.</p><p>Most of the short stories in this collection were written as assignments. Editors like Donald R. Gallo and Michael Green, writing colleagues like Lois Duncan and Harry Mazer, ask us to write short stories for collections they&#x2019;re putting together. Sometimes they give us a theme, sometimes not. Sometimes they give us the length, sometimes not. They always give us deadlines. Real life turns out to be strangely like school: You have assignments&#x2014;and deadlines. Yet deadlines are our friends. The deadline helps us find the time to write the story.</p><p>But how much easier to talk about writing than to write. How much easier to generalize about a whole generation of readers than to reach just one of them upon the shared page&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>The First</p><p>The first short story stands alone because it&#x2019;s the first one I ever wrote. And because it may be the most widely read of anything I&#x2019;ve ever written, of any length. From this story, I learned that short stories can go places novels can&#x2019;t&#x2014;into textbook anthologies and other people&#x2019;s collections and endless magazine reprints in any number of languages.</p><p>This one goes first because it proves that a writer can&#x2019;t have a master plan for his career. A writer has to be ready to turn on a dime.</p><p>One day more than twenty-five years ago, I was bent over the typewriter in the midst of a novel when the phone rang. It was the editor of a magazine for teenagers. She said she&#x2019;d been reading my novels and wanted me to write a short story for her magazine. It had to be set in junior high/middle school. She already had too many stories about high school.</p><p>When I could get a word in, I told her I didn&#x2019;t do short stories.</p><p>&#x201c;We pay three hundred dollars,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;It has to be very short,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;about a thousand words, and it needs to end with a bang. That&#x2019;s the good news. The bad news is that we&#x2019;ll need it by Thursday.&#x201d;</p><p>She hung up, and I had thirty-six hours to write my first short story. All I knew about it was that it had to be set in junior high, so I assumed the girl would be bigger than the boy. The story unfolded from there.</p><p>I knew too that I wouldn&#x2019;t be working on my novel for thirty-six hours, that I wouldn&#x2019;t be leaving the house, that I&#x2019;d be bringing my meals to the desk.</p><p>What I didn&#x2019;t know was that years later in another century, I&#x2019;d be putting together a collection of my short stories because of that one and how it opened a new door.</p><p>I called it &#x201c;Priscilla and the Wimps.&#x201d;</p><p>Priscilla and the Wimps</p><p>Listen, there was a time when you couldn&#x2019;t even go to the <i>restroom</i> around this school without a pass. And I&#x2019;m not talking about those little pink tickets made out by some teacher. I&#x2019;m talking about a pass that would cost anywhere up to a buck, sold by Monk Klutter.</p><p>Not that Mighty Monk ever touched money, not in public. The gang he ran, which ran the school for him, was his collection agency. They were Klutter&#x2019;s Kobras, a name spelled out in nailheads on six well-known black plastic windbreakers.</p><p>Monk&#x2019;s threads were more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;subtle. A pile-lined suede battle jacket with lizard-skin flaps over tailored Levi&#x2019;s and a pair of ostrich-skin boots, brass-toed and suitable for kicking people around. One of his Kobras did nothing all day but walk a half step behind Monk, carrying a fitted bag with Monk&#x2019;s gym shoes, a coil of restroom passes, a cash box, and a switchblade that Monk gave himself manicures with at lunch over at the Kobras&#x2019; table.</p><p>Speaking of lunch, there were cases of advanced malnutrition among the newer kids. The ones who were a little slow in handing over a cut of their lunch money and were therefore barred from the cafeteria. Monk ran a tight ship.</p><p>I admit it. I&#x2019;m five foot five, but when the Kobras slithered by, with or without Monk, I shrank. And I admit this too: I paid up on a regular basis. And I might add: so would you.</p><p>This school was old Monk&#x2019;s Garden of Eden. Unfortunately for him, there was a serpent in it. The reason Monk didn&#x2019;t recognize trouble when it was staring him in the face is that the serpent in the Kobras&#x2019; Eden was a girl.</p><p>Practically every guy in school could show you his scars. Fang marks from Kobras, you might say: lumps, lacerations, blue bruises. But girls usually got off with a warning.</p><p>Except there was this one girl named Priscilla Roseberry. Picture a girl named Priscilla Roseberry, and you&#x2019;ll be light years off. Priscilla was, hands down, the largest student in the school. I&#x2019;m not talking fat. I&#x2019;m talking big. Even beautiful, in a bionic way. Priscilla wasn&#x2019;t inclined toward organized crime. Otherwise, she could have put together a gang that would turn Klutter&#x2019;s Kobras into a bunch of garter snakes.</p><p>Priscilla was basically a loner except she had one friend, a little guy named Melvin Detweiler. You talk about The Odd Couple. Melvin&#x2019;s one of the smallest guys above midget status ever seen. They even had lockers next to each other in the same bank as mine. I don&#x2019;t know what they had going. I&#x2019;m not saying this was a romance. After all, people deserve their privacy.</p><p>Priscilla was sort of above everything, if you&#x2019;ll pardon a pun. And very calm, as only the very big can be. If there was anybody who didn&#x2019;t notice Klutter&#x2019;s Kobras, it was Priscilla.</p><p>Until one winter day after school when we were all grabbing our coats out of our lockers. And hurrying, since Klutter&#x2019;s Kobras made sweeps of the halls for after-school shakedowns.</p><p>Anyway, up to Melvin&#x2019;s locker swaggers one of the Kobras. Never mind his name. Gang members don&#x2019;t need names. They have group identity. He reaches down and grabs little Melvin by the neck and slams his head against his locker door. The sound of skull against steel rippled all the way down the locker now, speeding the crowds on their way.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s see your pass,&#x201d; snarls the Kobra.</p><p>&#x201c;A pass for what this time?&#x201d; Melvin asks, probably still dazed.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s call it a pass for very short people,&#x201d; says the Kobra. &#x201c;A dwarf tax.&#x201d; He wheezes a little Kobra chuckle, and already he&#x2019;s reaching for Melvin&#x2019;s wallet with the hand that isn&#x2019;t circling Melvin&#x2019;s windpipe. All this time, of course, Melvin and the Kobra are standing in Priscilla&#x2019;s big shadow.</p><p>She&#x2019;s taking her time shoving her books into her locker and pulling on an extra-large coat. Then, quicker than the eye, she brings the side of her enormous hand down in a chop that breaks the Kobra&#x2019;s hold on Melvin&#x2019;s throat. You could hear a pin drop in that hallway. Nobody&#x2019;d ever laid a finger on a Kobra, let alone a hand the size of Priscilla&#x2019;s.</p><p>Then Priscilla, who hardly ever says anything to anybody except to Melvin, says to the Kobra, &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s your leader, wimp?&#x201d;</p><p>This practically blows the Kobra away. First he&#x2019;s chopped by a girl. Now she&#x2019;s acting like she doesn&#x2019;t know Monk Klutter, the Head Honcho of the World. He&#x2019;s so amazed, he tells her. &#x201c;Monk Klutter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never heard of him,&#x201d; Priscilla mentions. &#x201c;Send him t...</p></p><h2>Corridor of Storms (First Americans, Book II)</h2><p><b>Panoramic, authentic, explosively dramatic&#x2014;this is the breathtaking new series <i>The First Americans</i>, which began with Book I, <i>Beyond The Sea Of Ice</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br><br>Now the heroic great hunter Torka, his woman Lonit, and his adopted son Karana emerge from a land forbidden to all men, a land where mountains walk and spirits speak. Across the fierce glacial tundra Torka leads his people&#x2014;survivors of a horrifying natural disaster&#x2014;to a winter camp where many bands gather to hunt the great mammoth. There he and his followers encounter an evil more dangerous than the wild lands&#x2014;the magic man called Navahlk, who vows cruel destruction of the bold hunter Torka. To survive they must draw upon the courage of one brave boy who will grow to manhood and see with his mind&#x2019;s eye where the sun&#x2019;s light has led them&#x2014;to the dawn of man on the American continent.</p><p>Joan Hamilton Cline is the real name of William Sarabande, author of the internationally bestselling First Americans series. She was born in Hollywood, California, and started writing when she was seventeen. First published in 1979, Joan has been writing as William Sarabande for eleven years. She lives with her husband in Fawnskin, California.1<br><br>"In the beginning, when the land was one land, when the People were one people, before Father Above made the darkness that ate the sun, before Mother Below gave birth to the ice spirits that grew to cover the mountains, the wanawut was born to hunt the children of First Man and First Woman--to follow them as we now follow the great herds, to feed upon the People even as the People feed upon the meat and blood of mammoth and caribou and bison. For this alone was the wanawut born: to teach the People the meaning of fear."<br><br>The words of the magic man flowed into the night, into the wind that licked the perimeters of the communal fire, teasing the flames with its cold breath, circling the encampment like a stalking, invisible predator, and chilling the fur-clad people who were gathered into a circle. His words reminded them that although they were bundled close together, spears at hand and daggers ready, and swathed in their many-layered garments of skins and fur--their faces painted with ash to make them appear bold--they were nevertheless small and frightened and vulnerable beneath the vast and savage Arctic sky.<br><br>The magic man stood with his arms raised and his remarkably handsome face upturned to the night. He was a man in his prime. In fringed garments sewn entirely of the white belly skins of winter-killed caribou, he shone like glacial ice on a moonlit night.<br><br>"Fear..." He exhaled the word lovingly, as an offering to the night, while the low, hissing tide of cold, dry, Ice Age wind blew across endless miles of glacier-laden ranges and rolling steppeland. He alone seemed at peace with the night, a conspirator with the wind that swept into the gathering and streamed with dark portent through the minds of every man, woman, and child who listened as he spoke and gestured before the great communal fire.<br><br>As though at his command, the flames leaped high, feeding noisily upon bones and lichens and thick, dried sods cut from the shallow surface of the permafrost. It was a hot, hungry fire, which warmed the magic man as it sent sparks so high that they seemed to join the uncountable stars that sprawled across the taut, black skin of the sky. He smiled, master of the night and the stars, of the wind and the fire, and in absolute control of the people who sat in cross-legged, hunch-shouldered awe of him.<br><br>All except the newcomer.<br><br>Torka.<br><br>Something dark and malevolent moved within the magic man as his eyes drifted to the tall, powerful, physically magnificent young hunter who sat straight and unmoving in a black-maned, tawny outercoat of lion skin.<br><br>Torka.<br><br>Navahk, magic man, nearly hissed the hated name aloud. If only Supnah--his brother, and headman of the band--had not managed to persuade Torka to stay, he would be long gone and far away by now. Yes, Torka had been set to go. He had vowed to lead his infant-suckling woman and his cursed dogs and the boy whom he dared to call son into the unknown and forbidden country that lay to the east. He had told the people of Supnah's band that from a high promontory he had looked out across the forbidden land and had seen much game there. He had all but begged Supnah and his band to follow him; but the other man was not willing to commit his people to the unknown.<br><br>Supnah had spoken of a headman's responsibilities to his band with such persuasive eloquence that Torka had been sobered. Although he had already secured his pack frame onto his back, in the end Supnah had convinced him that for the sake of his woman and child, he must stay within the protection of the larger band, among those who would name him brother. In time, if the spirits of the game and the forces of Creation decreed that it might be so, perhaps they might yet venture into the forbidden land together. But for now the people of Supnah's band would remain in the land of their fathers. And so, although the woman had boldly urged him to go on, Torka had deferred to the wisdom of the older man and had chosen to remain with the people of Supnah's band. He had turned his back upon the far and forbidden country and had traveled west with Supnah's people to this night of fire and feasting.<br><br>The magic man's smile twisted into a leer of contempt and loathing. Before Torka had joined them, they had been starving. Now, suddenly, the land around them was rich in game. Many said that Torka brought the meat to die upon the spears of the hunters, and Navahk, who as magic man had always taken credit for bringing the game, did not know whom he despised more: Torka or Supnah.<br><br>Torka was staring back at him now, his face impassive and nearly as handsome in the firelight as the magic man's. Unused to rivals, Navahk hated him for that and because, while the thoughts of others were as easy for him to follow as mammoth tracks on a muddy outwash plain, the magic man found it impossible to know the thoughts of Torka. Unless Torka allowed him to know them.<br><br>Torka had made it no secret that he was a man who had endured much pain and suffering. He had lived with fear and had triumphed over it. It held little mystery for him; if anything, he was contemptuous of it. His body carried scars inflicted by wolves, bear, and mammoth, and by the lion in whose skin he walked. Why should he tremble at a magic man's tales of a legendary beast that he had never seen, when he had faced so many real threats and overcome them? Fear weakened a man and made him vulnerable to predators. And it was apparent from the way he observed the magic man that Torka knew that he was predacious.<br><br>Frustrated, Navahk looked away from Torka, determined not to be intimidated by him. He would drive him from the band or see him dead, along with the one Torka called son. The idea caught fire within him. He smiled. Then he actually laughed, and suddenly he leaped high and began to whirl in the firelight. He danced as gracefully as a hawk soaring upon the wind. He sang the high, wild, wordless songs of wolves and wild dogs and of stallions driving mares before them upon the vast, open grasslands of the summer tundra. He became prey and predator, bear and lion, mammoth and caribou, and then, hunching into a bestial crouch, he rocked himself on his heels and wailed and hissed, leaped and prowled, no longer flesh but spirit, the thing of which he warned his people--the wanawut.<br><br>He heard the women gasp with fear as the men murmured appreciation for the intricate savagery of his dance. He did not care about them. Instead he paused before Torka, smiling to mask his jealousy of the man's masculine beauty and unperturbable calm. The magic man raised his skin-beribboned ceremonial staff of office, a fire-hardened thighbone of a camel atop which the horned, oiled skull of an antelope gleamed and stared sightlessly at the newcomer. He shook the staff viciously at Torka, and all the claws, talons, and beaks sewn onto the streaming ribbons of skin rattled and clicked.<br><br>"Does Torka not fear the wanawut now that he has seen its spirit come to dance within the skin of Navahk?"<br><br>Torka did not move. He was startled by the rapaciousness he glimpsed within the magic man's eyes, and chose not to react to it visibly. "Torka is wary of all things he does not understand."<br><br>The magic man glared at him, hating him. Torka, having seen the threat in Navahk's eyes, was as watchful as a grazing animal venturing to drink alone from a tundral pool where predators were known to lurk. But worse than that, his cool reserve toward the magic man was affecting Supnah, the headman of the band. Supnah. Navahk's lips flexed downward. His brother was such a wise and wary man in all things, except when it came to his younger brother. With Navahk, Supnah's credulity and gullibility had always been without bounds. Until Torka had walked into their lives. Now the magic man's words, gestures, and well-practiced performance had left the older man unimpressed . . . as he had been unimpressed with his brother ever since encountering Torka alone upon the tundra, pursuing slavers who had stolen his woman and boy.<br><br>The name of that boy was Karana. Abandoned with most of the children of Supnah's band during a time of famine, the boy alone had survived, to be later found and adopted by Torka, who had come to love him as a son. Torka had spoken Karana's name, imploring the hunters of Supnah to help him rescue his woman and the boy from the slavers who had stolen them and murdered his grandfather. The people of Supnah had cried out in surprise while the headman had stood in mute disbelief, a woman's tears welling beneath his lids. Karana was Supnah's son--his only son--and Navahk was the magic man responsible for the children's abandonment; he had also sworn that he had seen a vision of the deaths of Karana and all the other children who had been abandoned with him.<br><br>"Do not look back," he had told their grieving parents. "This man has seen the children in his dreams, and they are food for beasts and for Spirit Sucker, the wanawut that howls in the time of long dark as it feeds upon the flesh of our abandoned little ones. Their life spirits are released to the wind, so those small, useless ones who have died in order that the strong among us would not starve may be born again to their people in better times."<br><br>But now Karana, the child whom Navahk had declared dead, sat alive and healthy beside his father, reunited with his people because of Torka. The boy stared at the magic man out of black, hostile eyes, which seemed to pierce straight to Navahk's heart.<br><br>The muscles of the magic man's jawline tensed visibly. Karana's eyes had always been able to pierce him. How he loathed the child and Torka and Supnah! How small and culpable they made him feel, even though he stood boldly against the night, working his magic for their pleasure while wishing that he could make the words strike all three of them dead.<br><br>His mouth grew taut over his small, white, oddly serrated teeth. If only he had been born first, brawny instead of beautiful, and with the potential to be even half as good a hunter as his brother! He would take his brother's place, and no man would ever question the validity of his dreams or magic again.<br><br>Not that they ever had . . . until Karana had walked back into their lives out of the world of spirits to which Navahk had consigned him.<br><br>Now, as a result, Supnah looked at his brother with speculation rather than adulation. He sat at the front of the men's side of the circle of his assembled people, in the full regalia of his rank. Because he was an unpretentious man, it was minimal: the headman's circlet of eagle, hawk, and teratorn feathers about his head; and around his neck, over his outer tunic, a collar of the downy breast skins of those birds, to which their taloned claws had been sewn. They hung like a fringe made of desiccated fingers, clicking dully in the wind as Supnah sat stoically upon his lichen-and-down-stuffed sitting pad of bearskin, in the place where errant smoke was least likely to offend his nostrils or burn his eyes. He had seated Torka in a position of honor to his left and had placed Karana at his right. Now and then he looked down at the boy and slung a broad, powerful arm around his slim shoulders, drawing him close, hugging him with open and profoundly paternal affection, as though he could not believe that the child was really there; then he would lean forward slightly and look at Torka, nodding to indicate a depth of appreciation that no words could express.<br><br>Seeing that look, Navahk trembled with suppressed rage. The storytelling and magic were in celebration of Karana's miraculous return and in gratitude to Torka for having saved the life of the child. Since Torka had stepped into their lives, nothing had been the same. Wild dogs walked at his feet as though they were his brothers, and he had willingly shared knowledge of the miraculous spear hurler, which he had devised, with Supnah's band.<br><br>It was only an elongated shaft of bone approximately the length of a man's forearm, with a handgrip at one end and a barbed tip at the other. But with the sinew-wrapped grip held in the right hand, the butt end of the spear braced against the barb, and the narrowing, pointed end of the shaft facing back over his shoulder, a man could more than double the speed, distance, and power of his thrust. With this awe-inspiring weapon, Torka had led Supnah's hunters to a victory against the murderous slavers of the Ghost Band.<br><br>And now, thanks to Torka alone, a sense of power and self-determination had been reawakened within Supnah's band. The band had gaped at the newcomer as though he were a bright, warm sun rising on their world. As Navahk had stood by with murderous resentment, the people of Supnah's band had listened spellbound while Torka told them how a rampaging bull mammoth had destroyed his band--how he had dared to face its raging fury, been charged and lifted by its great tusks, fixed a spear in its shoulder, then was thrown and left to die, only to rise from death. Out of all his people, only he, his woman, and his ancient grandfather survived the appalling devastation that the beast had wrought. The three had fled eastward into unknown country, across the savage, twisted hills of a distant land, vulnerable to predators and the marrow-freezing cold of the endless nights. Nevertheless, they had survived the incomparable hardships until, at last, they sought refuge within a cave high upon a distant mountain. They had found shelter from the storms, and the filthy, stinking nest of a small, frightened child--Karana--who had also climbed the heights for safety.<br><br>Under Torka's leadership Supnah's hunters had killed many of the Ghost Band, which had preyed upon the people of the tundra for as long as any of them could remember, and had taken to their fires a dozen tattooed young women captives. The women's faces shone with pleasure in their new circumstances, and their eyes glowed with wonder at the overpowering physical perfection and astounding beauty of the magic man.<br><br>Navahk smiled. Their obvious adoration momentarily overshadowed his feelings of frustration. They, at least, were beguiled by his tales of enchantment, which had first been told at the dawn of his people's memory to drive back their fears and reassure them of their place within their world.<br><br>But sensing that his position within the band was in jeopardy, he had chosen another enchantment. Tonight Navahk had conjured fear and had danced with it through the flame light as though it were his lover. He had made it his ally, reaffirming his own status by loosing the beast of terror among his people--a beast that only he, as magic man, could control. It was a method he had long used to manipulate his brother to serve his own ambitions.<br><br>"Navahk says this to his people: In his dream times, this man had seen the wanawut walking in the mountains to the east. It hungers in the night. It longs to feast upon the flesh of those who would follow Torka into the new and unknown land into which he would lead us."<br><br>The magic man fell silent. Supnah was looking at him out of eyes that seemed to strip him to the bone. His arms folded across his chest, his weatherworn but still handsome features set into a watchful scowl, the headman seemed a stranger, his eyes fixed upon his brother with a mixture of contempt and pity.

After the first show their band, Television, lands a regular string of Sundays. By the end of the year a scene has developed that includes Tom Verlaine's new love interest, a poet-turned rock chanteuse named Patti Smith. American punk rock is born. Bryan Waterman peels back the layers of this origin myth and, assembling a rich historical archive, situates Marquee Moon in a broader cultural history of SoHo and the East Village. As Waterman traces the downtown scene's influences, public image, and reputation via a range of print, film, and audio recordings we come to recognize the real historical surprises that the documentary evidence still has to yield and come to a new appreciation of this quintessential album of the New York City night.</p><p>Bryan Waterman teaches American literature and culture at New York University.

Shrabani Basu tells the moving story of Noor&#39;s life from her birth in Moscow - where her father was a Sufi preacher - to her capture by the Germans. Noor was one of only three women SOE awarded the George Cross and, under torture, revealed nothing but her name - but not her real name, nor her code name, just the name she used to register at SOE: Nora Baker. Kept in solitary confinement, chained between hand and feet and unable to walk upright, Noor existed on bowls of soup made from potato peelings. Ten months after she was captured, she was taken to Dachau and, on 13 September 1944, she was shot. Her last word was &#39;Liberte&#39;.</p><p>Shrabani Basu is a correspondent for the Ananda Bazaar Patrika Group. She writes for the Telegraph, Sunday magazines and other publications in the group.

For nearly eight hundred years, this text (also known by its Japanese name, <i>Mumonkan</i>) has been the most widely used <i>koan</i> collection in Zen Buddhism&#x2014;and with its comic storytelling and wild poetry, it is also a remarkably compelling literary masterwork. In his radical new translation, David Hinton places this classic for the first time in the philosophical framework of its native China, in doing so revealing a new way of understanding Zen&#x2014;in which generic &#x201c;Zen perplexity&#x201d; is transformed into a more approachable and earthy mystery. With the poetic abilities he has honed in his many translations, Hinton brilliantly conveys the book&#x2019;s literary power, making it an irresistible reading experience capable of surprising readers into a sudden awakening that is beyond logic and explanation.</p><p>David Hinton&#x2019;s many translations of classical Chinese poetry have earned wide acclaim for creating compelling contemporary poems that convey the texture and density of the originals. He is also the first translator in over a century to translate the five seminal masterworks of Chinese philosophy: <i>I Ching</i>,<i> T<i>ao Te Ching</i></i>,&nbsp;<i>Chuang Tzu</i>,&nbsp;<i>Analects</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Mencius</i>. Hinton has received many national awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, both major awards for poetry translation, and most recently, a lifetime achievement award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.&#x201c;I love this book!&nbsp;The classic koans of the <i>No-Gate Gateway</i> are brilliantly and boldly translated by poet and scholar David Hinton. The introduction and notes are rich resources that open doors to the heart of Zen.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roshi Joan Halifax, author of <i>Being with Dying</i> and <i>Standing at the Edge</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;David Hinton is a fabulous translator. This book is luminous and transparent. You can see the light of the original Chinese masters shining through.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roshi John Tarrant, author of <i>Bring Me the Rhinoceros<br></i><br> &#x201c;David Hinton is the best English language translator of classic Chinese poetry we have, and have had for decades. A magician&#x2019;s grace glows through all of the poems, a grace and ease uncommonly found, uncommonly masterful.&#x201d;&#x2014;from the citation for the Thornton Wilder Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Translation, American Academy of Arts and Letters<br><br>&#x201c;Hinton&#x2019;s translation comes without the additional commentary we see in contemporary Western editions of the work, and his reader&#x2019;s guide can help practitioners deepen their study. The book also includes translator&#x2019;s notes, though these aren&#x2019;t placed in text. Thus, readers may linger on each case, allowing the reading experience to loosen their proclivity for binary thought.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Tricycle: The Buddhist Review&nbsp;</i></p><h2>The Last Light of the Sun</h2><p><p><strong>A powerful, moving saga evoking the Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Norse cultures of a thousand years ago from the acclaimed author of The Fionavar Tapestry.<br><br><strong>&#x201c;A historical fantasy of the highest order, the work of a man who may well be the reigning master of the form.&#x201d;</strong>&#x2014;<em>The Washington Post Book World</em><br><br></strong>Bern Thorkellson, punished for his father&#x2019;s sins, denied his heritage and home, commits an act of vengeance and desperation that brings him face-to-face with a past he&#x2019;s been trying to leave behind...<br><br>In the Anglcyn lands of King Aeldred, the shrewd king, battling inner demons all the while, shores up his defenses with alliances and diplomacy&#x2014;and with swords and arrows.

From the rubble of the Napoleonic empire in the nineteenth century through the birth of the League of Nations and the United Nations in the twentieth century to the dominance of global finance at the turn of the millennium, Mazower masterfully explores the current era of international life as Western dominance wanes and a new global balance of powers emerges.</p><p><b>Mark Mazower</b> is the Ira D.

Burden Hill looks at first glance to be the epitome of the idyllic suburb, but unbeknownst to its human populace the place is rife with all manner of supernatural menaces, both great and small. Werewolves, hauntings, black magic covens, and less easily defined things that go bump in the night wreak havoc just under the radar of man's perception, but do not go unnoticed by the unlikeliest occult protectors of all: a group of household pets comprising several dogs and a stray cat. These four-footed paranormal investigators, occasionally aided by "wise dogs" trained in the arcane arts, take on all comers with devotion and diligence. Dorkin's clever writing and Thompson's charming painted art effortlessly draw in readers--Thompson's realistic take creates a full world to get immersed in. Loaded with fun in every panel, this series has massive crossover appeal for those who enjoy horror, humor, and stories about endearing animal characters.

Creoleness, therefore, becomes a metaphor for humanity in all its diversity. Unique among the many images useful for discussing diversity, Creoleness is formed within a history of injustice, oppression, and empire. Creolization offers a way of envisioning a future through the interplay between cultural diversity, injustice and oppression, and intersectionality. People of faith must embrace such metaphors and practices to be relevant and effective for ministry in the 21st century. Using biblical exposition in conversation with present day Creole metaphors and cultural research, <i>Becoming Like Creoles</i> seeks to awaken and prepare followers of Jesus to live and minister in a world where injustice is real and cultural diversity is rapidly increasing. This book will equip ministry readers to embrace a Creole process, becoming culturally competent and social justice focused, whether they are emerging from a history of injustice or they are heirs of privilege.</p></p><p><p><b>Curtiss Paul DeYoung</b> is the Chief Executive Officer of the Minnesota Council of Churches.

It was not long before Mary discovered that her new husband was interested only in securing sovereign power for himself. Then, on February 10, 1567, an explosion at his lodgings left Darnley dead; the intrigue thickened after it was discovered that he had apparently been suffocated before the blast. After an exhaustive reevaluation of the source material, Alison Weir has come up with a solution to this enduring mystery. Employing her gift for vivid characterization and gripping storytelling, Weir has written one of her most engaging excursions yet into Britain&#x2019;s bloodstained, power-obsessed past.</p><p><b>Alison Weir </b>is the author of four other books on English history, including <b>Eleanor of Aquitaine</b>. She lives outside London with her husband and two children.The Three Crowns<br><br>TO EVERYONE'S DISMAY, THE BABY born to James V of Scotland and his second wife, Marie de Guise, on 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace was a girl. After the deaths of two infant sons in 1541, her father had hoped for another boy to succeed him, because Scotland needed a man's strong hand to rule it. For James V was already mortally ill, and following a crushing defeat by the English at the Battle of Solway Moss on 24 November, he had taken to his bed at Falkland Palace. When news was brought to him of the birth of his daughter, he turned his face to the wall and, recalling that the crown had descended to the Stewart dynasty through Marjorie, daughter of King Robert the Bruce, muttered, "It came from a woman, and it will end in a woman." Soon afterwards he died, "wherefore there was great mourning in Scotland."<br><br>At only six days old, the infant Mary became Queen of Scots. Scotland was used to royal minorities, for every one of its monarchs since 1406 had succeeded as a child. As a result, the nobility had grown in strength and autonomy, having become used to long periods without royal interference during which they enjoyed the unfettered exercise of power. These minorities had also bred rivalries and factions, as different families struggled for power.<br><br>In March 1543, Parliament appointed Mary's cousin and next heir, James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, as Second Person and Governor of the Realm until the Queen attained her majority at the age of twelve. Arran, then twenty-seven, was a Protestant, and head of the powerful Hamilton clan, whose lands straddled Clydesdale and central Scotland. An English envoy described the Hamiltons as a good looking race, but vicious, faithless and inept. Arran's claim to the succession was not undisputed, because there was uncertainty as to whether his parents had been lawfully married; hence his overriding purpose in life was to establish the legality of his claim. Self-interest and the advancement of his House dictated his political policies, but his indolence, instability and lack of decisiveness lost him the support of many nobles.<br><br>The King of England at that time was Henry VIII, and he was resolved to marry his five-year-old son and heir, Prince Edward, to the little Queen of Scots, and thereby unite England and Scotland under Tudor rule. Arran, eager to secure the support of the English King for his claims, was willing to co-operate, and on 1 July 1543 a treaty was concluded at Greenwich, which provided for the marriage of Mary and Edward. Mary was to go to England when she was ten, and be married the following year.<br><br>But the Catholic party in Scotland, led by Marie de Guise and Cardinal David Beaton, were opposed to the treaty. They removed Mary from Arran's care, took her to Stirling Castle, and had her crowned there, in the Chapel Royal, on 9 September. In December, a Catholic-dominated Parliament repudiated Mary's betrothal and renewed the ancient alliance between Scotland and France, England's enemy.<br><br>Henry VIII was incensed, and in 1544 retaliated by sending an army to Scotland. The savage campaign that followed became known as the "rough wooing": in the course of it, scores of towns, villages and abbeys in the south-east were mercilessly sacked and burned, leaving vast swathes of devastation. Even the city of Edinburgh did not escape Henry's fury: he had ordered his commanders to sack, "burn and subvert it, and put every man, woman and child to the sword." Far from bringing the Scots to heel, the barbarity of the English only strengthened them in their resolve.<br><br>In 1543, there had returned to Scotland a man who was to play a prominent role in the drama of Mary, Queen of Scots. Matthew Stuart, 4th Earl of Lennox, whose power base was centred upon Glasgow, had been born in 1516 at Dumbarton, and had succeeded to his earldom at the age of ten, after the murder of his father by Arran's bastard half-brother. This was cause enough for bad blood between Lennox and Arran, but they were also bitter rivals for the succession. Like Arran, Lennox was descended from Mary, daughter of James II, but only in the female line; unlike Arran, he had been born in undisputed wedlock. With such contentious issues dividing them, there could be no friendship between the Lennox Stuarts and the Hamiltons.<br><br>In 1531, Lennox had gone to France, where he joined the royal guard, became a naturalised subject of the French King and changed the spelling of his surname from Stewart to Stuart. Twelve years later, to Arran's consternation, he returned to Scotland and began paying court to Marie de Guise. Like most women, she found him handsome, charming and gallant: he was "a strong man of personage, well-proportioned with lusty and manly visage, and carried himself erect and stately, wherefore he was very pleasant in the sight of gentlewomen." A well-educated man, he spoke fluent French and was skilled at playing the lute. The Queen Dowager and Cardinal Beaton believed Lennox to be an ardent Francophile who would support them against the ambitions of Arran. But Lennox was unreliable, treacherous and driven by self-interest, and when Marie refused to marry him, he defected to the English in search of better prospects. In return for his support against the Scots, Henry VIII bestowed on him the hand of his niece, Lady Margaret Douglas.<br><br>The wedding took place in July 1544 at St. James's Palace in London. Born in 1515, Margaret was the daughter of Henry VIII's elder sister, Margaret Tudor (widow of James IV and grandmother of Mary, Queen of Scots) by her second husband, Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus; Margaret was therefore near in blood to the English throne, and a marriage between her and Lennox could only reinforce the dynastic claims of both parties. Yet although their union was politically advantageous, it was also a love match on both sides: he was said to be "far in love," and in his letters, he addressed his wife as "mine own sweet Madge" or "my Meg," told her she was his "chiefest comfort," and signed himself "Your own Matthieu and most loving husband." Margaret was a devout Catholic, so Lennox, who had been reared in the old faith but recently converted to Protestantism, now tempered his spiritual views to please his wife and King Henry; religion was ever a matter of expediency with him.<br><br>Margaret Douglas was a formidable woman. Beautiful, intelligent, domineering and relentlessly ambitious, she had an alarming talent for dangerous intrigue. She had spent much of her youth at the English court and become a great favourite of her uncle the King, but incurred his anger when she twice, in 1536 and 1541, became involved with unsuitable men; on each occasion Henry sent her for a spell in the Tower, a place with which she was to be become all too familiar during the course of her turbulent life. There can be no doubt that Margaret Douglas became the driving force in the Lennoxes' marriage.<br><br>In 1545, Lennox led an English army into Scotland in the hope of taking Dumbarton Castle for Henry VIII. It was during this campaign that he ordered the slaughter of eleven child hostages whose Scottish fathers had been forced into his ranks and then defected; this earned him undying notoriety and a perpetually haunted conscience. His offensive ended in failure, and on 1 October the Scottish Parliament attainted him for treason and confiscated all his estates and titles, some of which were given to Arran. Lennox was now the most hated man in Scotland. For the next nineteen years, he remained an exile in England, living on the bounty of Henry VIII. The Lennoxes' chief seat was Temple Newsham in Yorkshire, and they owned another house nearby at Settrington. When in London, they resided at the former royal manor of Hackney. Lennox never abandoned hope of regaining his lost lands and asserting his dynastic claims, his ambitions having been sharpened by his grand marriage and the birth of eight children, who inherited the royal blood of both Scotland and England.<br><br>During the 1540s, the impact of the Protestant Reformation began to be felt in Scotland. For decades now, the Catholic Church in Scotland had been morally lax and corrupt, and there had been calls for its reform. Now, religious affiliations became identified with political issues, and two noble factions emerged: the Catholics, who favoured the "auld alliance" with France, and a growing number of Protestants, who wanted closer relations with England, whose King, although a Catholic, had severed links with the Church of Rome and declared himself Supreme Head of the Church of England.<br><br>Trouble began when a Protestant heretic, George Wishart, was burned on the orders of Cardinal Beaton in 1546.

In Wilding, Isabella Tree tells the story of the `Knepp experiment&#39;, a pioneering rewilding project in West Sussex, using free-roaming grazing animals to create new habitats for wildlife. Part gripping memoir, part fascinating account of the ecology of our countryside, Wilding is, above all, an inspiring story of hope. Forced to accept that intensive farming on the heavy clay of their land at Knepp was economically unsustainable, Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell made a spectacular leap of faith: they decided to step back and let nature take over. Thanks to the introduction of free-roaming cattle, ponies, pigs and deer - proxies of the large animals that once roamed Britain - the 3,500 acre project has seen extraordinary increases in wildlife numbers and diversity in little over a decade. Extremely rare species, including turtle doves, nightingales, peregrine falcons, lesser spotted woodpeckers and purple emperor butterflies, are now breeding at Knepp, and populations of other species are rocketing. The Burrells&#39; degraded agricultural land has become a functioning ecosystem again, heaving with life - all by itself. Personal and inspirational, Wilding is an astonishing account of the beauty and strength of nature, when it is given as much freedom as possible.</p><p>Isabella Tree is an award-winning author, travel writer, and manager of the the Knepp Wildland Project, together with her husband Charlie. She is the author of several books, including The Living Goddess and The Bird Man.Brilliantly researched and scripted, this riveting and powerful book will revolutionise farming and nature conservation. -- <b>Matthew Oates</b>, National Specialist on Nature at the National Trust and author of <i>In Pursuit of Butterflies</i> I read Wilding at one go. It is both highly engaging and (equally important) very informative about a unique experiment in nature conservation, set in the context of the depressing decline in Britain's wildlife. Wilding the Knepp Estate is one of the most exciting wildlife conservation projects in the UK, and indeed in Europe. It's truly wonderful, and it fills me with hope. -- <b>Professor Sir John Lawton</b>, President of The Institution of Environmental Sciences, Chair of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution 2005-11 and author of the 2010 report <i>Making Space for Nature</i> A compelling account of a brave and far sighted venture. At a moment when the future of our countryside hangs in the balance, Isabella Tree helps us understand how we become locked in by our personal experience and perspectives. A riveting, gloriously written read which expands our imagination, and fuels our commitment to reversing the cataclysmic decline of virtually all species, other than our own. -- <b>Helen Browning</b>, Chief Executive of <b>The Soil Association</b> Charming, inspirational and thought-provoking. Beautifully captures the magic and excitement of the Knepp rewilding project. -- <b>Dave Goulson</b>, author of <i>Bee Quest</i> Isabella Tree's riveting book captures the excitement of an immensely powerful new idea: that to save our beleaguered wildlife, we should move beyond conserving what remains - we should restore what we have lost. Fascinating in its detail and thrilling in its sense of possibilities, this is essential reading for anyone concerned with the future of the natural world in the demanding times to come. -- <b>Michael McCarthy</b>, author of <i>The Moth Snowstorm: Nature and Joy</i> Wilding is truly the most magnificent and inspiring book. -- <b>Adam Nicholson</b>, author of <i>The Seabird's Cry</i> Charming, inspirational and thought-provoking. Beautifully captures the magic and excitement of the Knepp rewilding project. -- Professor Dave Goulson So often we read of the countryside in shock and so seldom to we learn of its recovery.

Beautifully written, it marks the moment when the task at hand can no longer be about slowing down the inexorable decline of wildlife, but to begin the job of restoration. -- <b>Tony Juniper</b>, former Executive Director of <b>Friends of the Earth</b> A thrilling, inspiring and deeply moving story of a wildlife revolution on an ordinary English farm, Wilding shows us what we have lost and what we could regain if we change our relationship with the countryside. -- <b>Patrick Barkham</b>, author of <i>Badgerlands</i> Every farmer (and perhaps every conservationist) in Britain needs to go and spend a day at Knepp. The Knepp `wilding' project is a vitally important experiment for working out what we can do to let Nature back into our farmed landscapes . . .

Behind him, he could hear the grunts of the half-giant Cronies as they chased him and the other Olympians across the sandy ground.<br> <br>Zeus risked a quick look behind him. The size and bulk of the Cronies, plus the armored chest plates they wore, were slowing the half-giants down. Hera and Poseidon were right behind Zeus, with Apollo behind them and Ares bringing up the rear.<br> <br>There should have been three more Olympians with them, but the Crony army had captured Hestia, Demeter, and Hades. Zeus tried not to think about that now. He couldn&#x2019;t save anybody if the Cronies captured him, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;We should stand and fight!&#x201d; Ares yelled.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never fought Cronies before!&#x201d; Zeus replied, looking back at Ares. He was the newest member of the Olympians. Ares had lived with a family of giant Titans his whole life up till now. &#x201c;We may not be stronger than they are, but we&#x2019;re always faster. We just&#x2014; Oof!&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus tripped over a rock and fell facedown onto the ground. Before he could get back to his feet, he felt a hand grip each of his arms.<br> <br>Hera and Poseidon had grabbed him. They pulled him up. These two Olympians&#x2014;along with Hades, Hestia, and Demeter&#x2014;were Zeus&#x2019;s brothers and sisters. (Although, they had only just found this out.) Even though Apollo wasn&#x2019;t their brother, he had joined the group like he was one of them too. His singing rhymes were both funny and kind of annoying!<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice move, Bolt Breath!&#x201d; Hera teased.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see it!&#x201d; Zeus protested.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, guys&#x2014;still running!&#x201d; Poseidon called back, jogging ahead of them.<br> <br>Apollo caught up to them. &#x201c;I see some trees up on the right. If we hide there we&#x2019;ll be out of sight,&#x201d; sang the blond-haired boy.<br> <br>&#x201c;How can you rhyme at a time like this?&#x201d; Hera asked, rolling her blue eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hiding in the trees is a good idea. Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; Zeus cried.<br> <br>They veered toward the right and headed into the stand of trees. Zeus came to a stop, panting.<br> <br>&#x201c;We need a plan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There are four half-giant Cronies chasing us, but there&#x2019;s a whole army of them in the canyon below. They won&#x2019;t stop until they find us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We need Pythia,&#x201d; Poseidon said, frowning. The Oracle of Delphi always showed up to tell them what to do next. But after they&#x2019;d found Ares, she hadn&#x2019;t appeared.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve got to lose these half-giants and get to Delphi,&#x201d; Zeus told him.<br> <br>Ares&#x2019;s red eyes flashed. &#x201c;Forget losing them. Let&#x2019;s attack them!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;These guys don&#x2019;t go down easily,&#x201d; Zeus said. &#x201c;And even if we defeat the first four, there&#x2019;s a whole army behind them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhh!&#x201d; Hera warned, quickly darting behind a tree. &#x201c;I think they&#x2019;re close-by.&#x201d;<br> <br>Apollo, Poseidon, and Zeus all scrambled to hide behind trees too. But not Ares. He raised his spear and charged through the trees, screaming so loudly that the sound echoed through the hills.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am Ares the Olympian! Feel my anger!&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;We shall not be defeated!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; Hera whispered. &#x201c;Is he serious?&#x201d;<br> <br>He was. Zeus thought Ares looked pretty ferocious as he sped through the trees with his sharp spear, spiky brown hair, and weird, fiery eyes. But Zeus knew that Ares didn&#x2019;t stand a chance against the Cronies on his own. He darted out from behind the tree.<br> <br>&#x201c;Zeus, don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; Hera hissed.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s one of us,&#x201d; Zeus reminded her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to help him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hera sighed. &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, and Apollo raced after Ares. They found him standing just outside the trees, frozen in fear as he stared at the approaching Cronies. Zeus couldn&#x2019;t blame him. Each Crony was about eight feet tall and massively muscled. They brandished clubs, spears, and sharp arrows.<br> <br>Zeus grabbed him. &#x201c;Come on, Ares. Let&#x2019;s stick to the plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wh-what plan?&#x201d; Ares asked, his bottom lip trembling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run!&#x201d; Zeus yelled.<br> <br>The chase began again. The Olympians raced off along the edge of the mountain ridge. Somewhere down below, Zeus knew, was the rest of King Cronus&#x2019;s army.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t escape us, Olympians!&#x201d; one of the Cronies bellowed. Zeus saw Ares turn pale as he ran by his side.<br> <br>Ares can talk a good talk, Zeus thought. But can he back it up?<br> <br>The Olympians quickly gained another lead on the Cronies. But then Poseidon came to a quick halt up ahead of Zeus.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold on, guys!&#x201d; Poseidon yelled.<br> <br>Zeus suddenly realized why Poseidon had stopped. The Cronies had chased them to a dead end&#x2014;a narrow ledge overlooking the canyon. Zeus ran to the edge and looked over. The canyon wall was too steep to climb down, and too high to jump from. Deep, rocky craters and sharp boulders dotted the landscape below.<br> <br>Hera, Apollo, and Ares arrived next, panting.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re done for!&#x201d; Ares wailed, looking down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yup, sure seems that way,&#x201d; Hera agreed.<br> <br>The five of them turned to face the Cronies. One of them had a big scar across his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got you now!&#x201d; he growled.</p><h2>The Maps of Fredericksburg: An Atlas of the Fredericksburg Campaign, Including all Cavalry Operations, September 18, 1862 - January 22, 1863</h2><p>Finalist, 2018, Reference, Army Historical Foundation Distinguished Book Award<br><br>The Maps of Fredericksburg: An Atlas of the Fredericksburg Campaign, Including all Cavalry Operations, September 18, 1862 - January 22, 1863 continues Bradley M. Gottfried&#x2019;s efforts to study and illustrate the major campaigns of the Civil War&#x2019;s Eastern Theater. This is his sixth book in the ongoing Savas Beatie Military Atlas Series.<br><br>After Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s Army of Northern Virginia was forced out of Maryland in September 1862, President Abraham Lincoln grew frustrated by Maj. Gen. George McClellan&#x2019;s failure to vigorously purse the Rebels and replaced him with Ambrose Burnside. The opening stages of what would come to be the Fredericksburg Campaign began in early October when the armies moved south. After several skirmishes, it became clear Burnside would force a crossing at Fredericksburg and drive south. Delays in doing so provided General Lee with time to get his troops into position behind the city.<br><br>The initial fighting occurred on December 11 when a single Mississippi Confederate brigade gallantly delayed the Union bridge-building efforts. Once across, Burnside&#x2019;s army prepared for action. The main battle took place on December 13, a two-pronged attack against Marye&#x2019;s Heights on the Union right and Prospect Hill at the opposite end of the line. Neither was successful. Burnside contemplated another attempt to flank Lee, but the January weather conspired against him and he was removed from command.<br><br>Unlike other treatments of this epic fight, The Maps of Fredericksburg plows new ground by breaking down the entire campaign into twenty-two map sets or &#x201c;action sections,&#x201d; enriched with 122 detailed full-page color maps. These cartographic originals bore down to the regimental and battery level, and include the march to and from the battlefield and virtually every significant event in between. At least two&#x2014;and as many as ten&#x2014;maps accompany each map set.

I'd always been attracted to big cities, and during my youth I can remember fooling myself that I'd actually get the hell out of here. That never happened. Through the years Union became the place I called home. Once you've put your roots down, it' very hard to pull them up to move on. Union is where my roots are. This is home.</p> <p>Union, Missouri is a small town fifty miles southwest of St. Louis. Take Interstate 44 west of the city, and the St. Louis suburbs quickly give way to smaller communities. Union is one of those small rural communities&#x2015;far enough away from the city to avoid the crowds, noise, and confusion. Pollution in Union has never been a problem. Look up at the sky on any clear night, and you'll see stars so clear and bright that it's sometimes hard to believe they're real. Union is a rural town, a small town. Like the town itself, its residents have aged. These days a small farming community like Union isn't booming, nor is it wealthy. But nor would I say the people in Union are for the most part poor; they just know how to make do. Generations of families on top of generations. The family trees of long-time Union residents are as long and wide as the streets in the old part of town. Union is the county seat of Franklin County, and the town square with its huge old courthouse acts as the centerpiece of town. The courthouse is rumored to have seen many hangings in its day. Old folks talk about families packing up picnic lunches to eat while sitting outside the courthouse, watching the bodies as they fell and went limp on their nooses.</p> <p>The true history of a town like Union is always kept by the old. And Union has its secrets, just like any other small town. Historic? Of course it is, but you would never know of the history and battles that it's seen because most of the historic locations remain unmarked. Union, Missouri is a small town like any other, and I call it my home. I live here and I raised my children here. It's the place I'e worked, sang, and prayed. It's my home. For better or worse, this is where I've laid down my roots. This is my home.</p> <p>I wish I could claim that I've led a fairy-tale existence in which good always conquers evil. Who wouldn't want that kind of life? Mine began that way, I thought. I had a happy childhood. I was born on January 3, 1965, in a hospital in St. Louis. Born to devout Lutheran parents, I was a large baby, twenty-four inches long. I spent my early years living in St. Louis County, in the city's northern suburbs. When I was eleven, my parents decided to leave St. Louis behind and move to the country, to Franklin County. As a city boy I always felt somewhat out of place in a farming community. We lived between the two towns of Washington and Union, right outside the small township of Krakow. My parents still live there, while I now live in Union.</p> <p>I was a good student, with high grades and even higher expectations. I was a great speaker and a fair musician. College was successful, and I made my mark as a national-champion debater. I married at twenty-three and became a first-time father shortly thereafter, when Lydia, my daughter, was born.</p> <p>Lydia came into this world as a crying, screaming bundle in September 1988. Her mother's pregnancy had been uneventful, and the delivering physician had no reason to suspect that Lydia's birth would be anything but routine. That quickly changed after my wife went into labor. Lydia, as if sensing the events that would one day shake our family to its foundation, poked her tiny head into the world and immediately returned to her mother's womb. The mood in the delivery room changed from one of relaxed if anxious anticipation to one of controlled chaos. Lydia turned when she elected to postpone her birth, and she was now in a breech position. Both her mother's and Lydia's vital signs indicated they were in distress. Suddenly, I was in danger of losing them both. An emergency cesarean section was performed, however, and Lydia was finally placed in my arms. Her tears and tiny form brought me out of the depths of my worry. Little did I know that Lydia's birth was a true harbinger of her personality and events that I would never have been able to imagine. Throughout the years she would always walk to the beat of her own drum. Strong-willed and levelheaded: that is my Lydia.</p> <p>A year later my son Michael was born&#x2015;one year and six days later to be exact. His birth went off without a hitch.</p> <p>"Mr. LaChance?"</p> <p>My attention was drawn away from my wife who was still positioned on the birthing table as if the hurried medical staff intended to crucify her later. Michael was brought into this world to the sound of his parents laughing, a sound he wouldn't hear for long.</p> <p>"Mr. LaChance? I'd like to introduce you to your son."</p> <p>The nurse handed me the most serious little baby I'd ever seen. <em>Serious</em> would continue to be the best word to describe Michael as he grew up. He was born amidst laughter and optimism on the part of his parents, but a pessimist he would be. Serious, with a deep sincerity. That is my Michael.</p> <p>Matthew was born eighteen months later, in January 1991, during one of the coldest winters on record. His was a natural birth, not as dramatic as Lydia's and not nearly as optimistic as Michael's. For reasons only she might understand, the light had already gone out in his mother's eyes. Despite being born on the coldest day of the century, even as a newborn Matthew was the warmest and sweetest of children, full of energy and life. But the first time I held him in my arms, this little bundle of energy calmed down at the sound of my voice.</p> <p>"Hello, little man," I whispered softly. And he was a "little man." His birth weight was ten pounds, and he was over twenty-four inches long. From then on he would always be taller than other children, a force to be reckoned with and one that couldn't be ignored. Inside his oversized body was a heart that would always overflow with love and affection as he matured. Oh, yes, a sweet and gentle soul was born into my life that day, and my heart was as warm as the day was cold. A gentle giant with a heart of gold: that is my Matthew.</p> <p>And they lived happily ever after&#x2015;how I wish I could conclude the story of my children's births that way. Unfortunately, Matthew's birth would be the last happy day in the life of my marriage. Four years after Matthew's arrival, I came home to find my wife sullen and depressed. Her dull eyes beseeched me to understand as she struggled to say her next words: "I'm leaving you."</p> <p>It's funny, but when you are in the midst of living your life, you become blind to the truth that's right in front of you. I hadn't seen this coming. And even if I had, I would have ignored it or talked myself out of it. It's hard to see the writing on the proverbial wall when you are constantly trying to hide from it.</p> <p>"It's not that I want to divorce you," she continued, trying to reassure me with a voice that I already mistrusted."I want to divorce the children." She stood to cross the room. "Dammit, Steven, I never wanted to be a mother. I did that for you. You always knew you wanted to be a father. It was and is just not for me. I can't do it. I try and I try, but I just can't seem to do it. This is the right thing. This is the most right thing that I can do for them and for you. It's me. It isn' you and it isn't them. This is about me." She steadied herself for what she had to say to me next." You have until Friday for you and the kids to find someplace to live. I haven't paid the rent in six months. Tomorrow they're turning off the electricity." At that moment, I began to gain the full, horrible understanding of what was happening. She was not only leaving us, but she was also stealing the money that was meant to keep us secure, keep us alive. She was leaving us homeless.</p> <p>The words echoed in my befuddled mind, and by the time I could think again, she was gone. Where had I failed? What had I done to lead her to leave us so abruptly? Why like this? Without a home. With only the shirts on our backs and very little that we could take with us. Just enough that each person could put into a box and bag of their own. So many things lost. Things that could never be replaced. A trust that was more than shattered.</p> <p>Shocked and shaken, I tried to figure out what I would do next. What would I tell my children? How could I tell them that their mother had left them? They didn't ask for this. The only consolation I could summon up was that she had waited for me to return home. Through my daze I remember her saying that she had considered simply leaving them at the grocery store. Somebody, she had said, would have found them and contacted me. I couldn't imagine that the woman I had met, loved, married, and conceived a family with, the mother of my children, would have ever considered abandoning her children in such a heartless manner. They would never have recovered from a trauma like that.</p> <p>The kids and I moved in with my parents for a six-month crash course in Parenting Skills 101. The women in my life, my mother and my wife, had allowed me to live a very sheltered life, and I had to learn even the simplest domestic skills. But I kept my eyes firmly on my children and the long road before us that we would have to travel together. Together? Who was I kidding? Although my parents would help as much as they could, ultimately I would have to do this alone, a single father to three young children. I certainly hadn't scripted this into my life plan. Life as I knew it had been dramatically, drastically, and permanently altered with a few words and the slamming of a door.</p> <p>I would find in the coming months and years that I could manage a pretty good life for all of us. My wife's visits to her children became less and less frequent, and the children's desire to be with her diminished with the passage of time. Their wounds would be with them forever, but I did my best to bandage and soothe them. By the grace of God I hoped that in the coming years they would become mature adults secure in the knowledge that they were loved, even if they had been abandoned by their mother. I knew, though, that despite my best efforts, pain this deep and personal would leave them scarred. I was saddened every time I thought about it&#x2015;saddened, pained, and hurt.</p> <p>In the years to come I would try to figure out why it all went so wrong so fast. I never did find the answer for myself, for my children, or for her. What causes a mother to give up her young? That completely goes against the laws of nature. Was it a prolonged postpartum depression? A nervous breakdown? Or did she just simply lose her mind? I don't think I'll ever fully have the answer. At least she knew what was best for them. Her words still echo in my mind, even now, this many years later: "This is the most right thing that I can do for them and for you." Well, at least she got that much right.</p></p><h2>Elseworlds: Batman Vol. 3</h2><p>Some of DC's most popular titles from the 1990s were published under the Elseworlds banner, which recast DC's heroes in strange settings with reimagined histories.

The supreme goal of physicists is to understand this order through laws that describe the behavior of the most basic particles and the forces between them. For centuries, we have searched for these laws by studying the results of experiments. Since the 1970s, however, experiments at the world's most powerful atom-smashers have offered few new clues. So some of the world's leading physicists have looked to a different source of insight: modern mathematics. These physicists are sometimes accused of doing 'fairy-tale physics', unrelated to the real world. But in <i>The Universe Speaks in Numbers</i>, award-winning science writer and biographer Farmelo argues that the physics they are doing is based squarely on the well-established principles of quantum theory and relativity, and part of a tradition dating back to Isaac Newton. With unprecedented access to some of the world's greatest scientific minds, Farmelo offers a vivid, behind-the-scenes account of the blossoming relationship between mathematics and physics and the research that could revolutionize our understanding of reality. A masterful account of the some of the most groundbreaking ideas in physics in the past four decades. <i>The Universe Speaks in Numbers</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in the quest to discover the fundamental laws of nature.</p><p><b>Graham Farmelo</b> is the author of several books, including<i> The Strangest Man</i>, which won the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize. Farmelo is a Fellow at Churchill College at the University of Cambridge, an Affiliated Professor at Northeastern University, and is a regular visitor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He lives in London."Will pure mathematics prevail over dogged experiments in investigating the physical world? Is the fulfillment of the Pythagorean dream of a mathematical universe finally at hand? Mr. Farmelo, deeply impressed with the accomplishments of Einstein, Dirac and string theorists, is optimistic."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i></i></b><br><br>"Farmelo shows that theoretical physics and pure mathematics thrive best together."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Scientific American </i></b></i></b><br><br>"These are brilliant successes of the mathematical approach, and Farmelo leads us through them adeptly, with a mixture of contemporary accounts and scientific insight."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Nature</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Despite the difficulties of writing about such specialised technical material, Farmelo has succeeded in writing a book for the general reader that gives insights into the motivation behind a theory developed by many of today's leading thinkers. His book provides as clear an account of the subject as I can imagine for a non-specialist reader."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Times Higher Education</i> (UK) </b></i></b><br><br>"Mathematics here becomes a brilliant laser beam illuminating the very frontiers of science!"&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Booklist STARRED</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A riveting account of one of the greatest stories of our time. Graham Farmelo has delved deep into this fascinating subject, combining original scholarship and lively interviews with leading contemporary theorists at the forefront of the field. The result is a masterful book, which gives us, for the first time, a behind-the-scenes look at how physicists and mathematicians, driven by their pursuit of ultimate Truth, have been drawn into common territory by mysterious intellectual forces seemingly beyond their control."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Nima Arkani-Hamed, professor, Institute of Advanced Study, Princeton</b></i></b><br><br>"A thought-provoking look at a fierce, ongoing controversy over the future of theoretical physics."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Crisply-written, entertaining and extraordinarily well-informed. The most popular and elegant theories of what makes the cosmos tick are becoming harder---even impossible---to test directly but Graham Farmelo argues in this tour de force that they're still taking us deep into the mathematical heart of reality."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Roger Highfield, author, journalist, and Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum, London</b></i></b><br><br>"This fascinating, splendidly readable, extensively researched, and remarkably up-to-date book takes readers from the days of Newton to the forefront of modern theoretical physics and shows how current research has reshaped the fields of physics and mathematics to the enrichment of both."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jeremy Gray, emeritus professor, Open University</b></i></b><br><br>"Farmelo expertly narrates the history of the dynamic dance between mathematics and theoretical physics, from Newton to Einstein to string theory and beyond.

With the coming of the railroad, the small town of Blessing begins to prosper, and the Bjorklund family is reaping the promised harvest that had lured them from their beloved home in Norway.<br><br>But for Ingeborg and Haakan, realizing their dreams will not come without a struggle. After their own fields are harvested, Haakan and the neighboring men take the steam engine and the separator on the road, threshing for other homesteaders in return for a portion of their grain. With Haakan away and the fields standing idle, Ingeborg frets over work yet to be done. Fearing an early change of seasons, she takes matters into her own hands. <br><br>Has the land become more important to Ingeborg than her own family?</p><p>LAURAINE SNELLING is an award-winning author of fifty-plus books, including her beloved series Dakotah Treasures and Red River of the North. She also writes for a wide range of magazines and teaches at writers&#39; conferences across the country. She and her husband make their home in Tehachapi, California.Snelling (A Land To Call Home, LJ 6/1/97) begins with the compelling story of Zeb MacCallister, who flees Missouri for the West after accidentally murdering a neighbor. Reluctantly teaming up with two malnourished orphan girls, Zeb eventually lands in Blessing, Dakota Territory. Unfortunately, the core of the book focuses on the trials and tribulations of the Bjorklund family, who are not half as interesting as Zeb and the girls. By the time Zeb and his two companions, especially the sulky and bad-tempered Manda, arrive in Blessing to give the Bjorklund family yet more problems to test their faith, readers may be wondering why a whole book was not devoted to such well-rounded and amusing characters. Still, readers who enjoyed the first three books in this series about immigrants settling the West will certainly want to read this one.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gertrude of Helfta: The Herald of Divine Love (Classics of Western Spirituality (Paperback))</h2><p>From her entrance to the Benedictine abbey of Helfta near Eisleben in Saxony, as a child of four in 1260, until her twenty-sixth year, Gertrude lived what she was later to consider a lax and worldly life, following the monastic observance outwardly, but applying her brilliant mind and boundless enthusiasm to secular studies. Then, when she was twenty-five, all was changed. The Lord appeared to her in the form of a beautiful youth inviting her to a conversion of life and to close union with himself. Thenceforth for Gertrude God was all, and her neighbor all in God, and she flung herself into his service with the same wholeheartedness which she had previously brought to her secular studies. She was continually granted extraordinary mystical favors, including an intense awareness of God&#39;s loving presence in her soul; and despite her great humility and consequent reluctance she understood that she had been granted these graces for the good of others and was therefore required to make them known.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>200 Best Panini Recipes</h2><p><p> <i>The fresh, robust flavors of Italian grilled sandwiches.</i> </p><p> A panini is an Italian-inspired pressed sandwich enjoyed throughout Italy and, increasingly, in North American caf�s, restaurants and kitchens.

Then I thought, Are there really 200 panini recipes?</p> <p>But just as my mom was, I am the master of sandwiches. I have been told I make the best sandwiches, and I think this is because I believe sandwich ingredients have zero limitation. And what is a panini but a pressed, grilled sandwich? When I looked at it that way, I knew I could create 200 <i>plus</i>. </p> <p>The potential ingredient lineup for sandwiches are endless, as are the combinations of flavors, both traditional and unusual. And you can take almost any sandwich and turn it into a panini, with a bit oflandscaping. You know, to keep the ingredients from oozing out too much. Once you step outside of the panini "box," you'll find that there are a million irresistible possibilities.</p> <p>In this book, I've included many of my favorite sandwiches, such as Turkey Panini with Cranberry Chutney and Sunflower Seeds (page 110), Beef and Brie Panini (page 127) and Shrimp Club Panini (page 80). I put my own spin on some traditional sandwich recipes, such as the classic Reuben Panini (page 135), the Monte Cristo Panini (page 143) and the Philly Chicken Panini (page 182). I figured out ways to reinvent other recipes I enjoy as delicious panini, as with the Chicken Caesar Panini (page 92), the Lobster Fontina Panini (page 84) and my signature sandwich, The Tiffany (page 166), which incorporates my favorite pizza toppings. I polled my friends and family to learn what flavor combinations they enjoy and turned those ingredients into panini, such as Marcia's Tuna and Swiss Panini (page 62) and the Open-Face Hawaiian Melt (page 218), my daughter's favorite treat. And I experimented to create brand-new flavor combinations that exceeded even my own expectations, such as Smashed White Bean, Avocado and Bacon Panini (page 158), Sardine and Balsamic Tomato Panini (page 64) and Mixed Berry and Mascarpone Panini with Toasted Almonds (page 227).</p></p><h2>In the Beginning Was Information</h2><p><p>Powerful <em>evidence</em> for the <em>existence</em> of a personal God!</p><p><strong>Information is the cornerstone of life</strong>, yet it is something people don't often think about. In his fascinating new book, <em>In the Beginning Was Information, </em>Dr. Werner Gitt helps the reader see how the very presence of information reveals a Designer:</p><ul><li><em>Do we take for granted the presence of information that organizes every part of the human body, from hair color to the way internal organs work?</em></li><li><i>What is the origin of all our complicated data?</i></li><li><i>How is it that information in our ordered universe is organized and processed?</i></li></ul> <p>Gitt explains the necessity of information - and more importantly, the need for an Organizer and Originator of that information. The huge amount of information present in just a small amount of DNA alone refutes the possibility of a non-intelligent beginning for life. It all points to a Being who not only organizes biological data, but also cares for the creation.</p></p><p>Werner Gitt, with a doctorate in engineering, has been a professor at the Federal Physics-Technology Institute in Braunschweig, Germany, since 1971.

It is not in the nature of cyberspace to be unregulable; cyberspace has no nature.&#x201d; It only has code-the software and hardware that make cyberspace what it is. That code can create a place of freedom-as the original architecture of the Net did-or a place of oppressive control. Under the influence of commerce, cyberspace is becoming a highly regulable space, where behavior is much more tightly controlled than in real space. But that's not inevitable either. We can-we must-choose what kind of cyberspace we want and what freedoms we will guarantee. These choices are all about architecture: about what kind of code will govern cyberspace, and who will control it. In this realm, code is the most significant form of law, and it is up to lawyers, policymakers, and especially citizens to decide what values that code embodies. Since its original publication, this seminal book has earned the status of a minor classic. This second edition, or Version 2.0, has been prepared through the author's wiki, a web site that allows readers to edit the text, making this the first reader-edited revision of a popular book.</p><p><b>Lawrence Lessig</b> is a professor at Stanford Law School and founder of the school's Center for the Internet and Society.

In her largest, most comprehensive volume to-date, North America's leading authority on grassfed meat examines the conundrum of maintaining a healthy, affordable and ecologically sound meat-based diet, while simultaneously paying America's small sustainable farmers a fair price for their food. "But to do it," she adds, "we need to expand our menus to include more than just the prime cuts, and we need to learn how to work with leftovers." <br> <br> More than just a cookbook, <em>Long Way on a Little</em> presents Hayes' practical knowledge about integrating livestock into a sustainable society with her accessible writing and engaging wit. Designed to be the only meat book a home cook could ever need, <em>Long Way on a Little</em> is packed with Hayes' signature delicious no-fail recipes for perfect roasts and steaks cooked indoors and out on the grill, easy-to-follow techniques to make use of the less-conventional, inexpensive cuts that often go to waste, tips on stretching a sustainable food budget, and an extensive section on using leftovers and creating soups; all with the aim of helping home cooks make the most effective and economical use of their local farm products or their own backyard livestock.</p> <p>While addressing the topic of making local food more affordable, Hayes also frankly grapples with tough health issues confronting so many Americans today, from diabetes to grain and gluten intolerance. The result is a family-pleasing, nutrient-dense, affordable cuisine that is a joy to prepare, rich in authentic flavor, and steeped in the wisdom of the world's greatest culinary traditions, all bundled together in a thought-provoking and informative book that is as stimulating to the mind as it is to the palate.

But in <b>Miss Julia Meets Her Match</b>, our feisty heroine must come to terms with her most ardent admirer of all: longtime beau Sam Murdoch, who wants to tie the knot. While it&#x2019;s hard to resist Sam&#x2019;s charm, Miss Julia isn&#x2019;t about to give up her independence so easily. After all, there are plenty of other matters that require her attention, including a Holy Land theme park to be built on her property, a possible affair between the mayor and the preacher&#x2019;s secretary, and the arrival of her housekeeper Lillian&#x2019;s five-year-old pistol of a great-granddaughter. In the midst of all the commotion, can her cool-as-a-cucumber head help her heart make the decision of a lifetime?</p><p><p><b><b>Ann B. Ross</b>&nbsp;</b>is the author of eighteen novels featuring the popular Southern heroine Miss Julia, as well as&nbsp;<i>Etta Mae's Worst Bad-Luck Day</i>, a novel about one of Abbotsville's other most outspoken residents: Etta Mae Wiggins.&nbsp;Ross holds a doctorate in English from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and has taught literature at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. She lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina.</p><i>Chapter 1</i><br><br>&#x201c;Where y&#x2019;all gonna live?&#x201d; Lillian asked, as she beat three eggs, one after the other, into a bowl of cake batter. &#x201c;If you thinkin&#x2019; &#x2019;bout tyin&#x2019; the knot, somebody gonna be movin&#x2019;.&#x201d; <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not studying a move.&#x201d; I was at the kitchen table, folding towels taken from the dryer. The window rattled from a gust of late April wind, and I glanced outside to see more rain clouds moving across the sky.</p><p>&#x201c;Huh. You better be studyin&#x2019; on it, Miss Julia. &#x2019;Cause either Mr. Sam be movin&#x2019; in here or you be movin&#x2019; in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s too far down the road to worry about,&#x201d; I said, not wanting to worry about it either down the road or at the moment. &#x201c;And, see, Lillian, that&#x2019;s part of the problem. Tying the knot. I don&#x2019;t know that I want to be tied to anybody, even Sam, who&#x2019;s as fine a man as I&#x2019;ve ever known. But that&#x2019;s what happens when you marry. I&#x2019;ve had a taste of doing things my way, you know, since Mr. Springer passed.&#x201d; I smoothed out a hand towel, smelling the packaged fresh air aroma rising from it. &#x201c;Even if that freedom came too late in life to be of much use. Lillian, do you realize that I was married for almost forty-five years, and never had a moment&#x2019;s peace? Always fearful of what would set him off, what would displease him, what I was doing wrong, and on and on. Now, I don&#x2019;t have to answer to anybody, and I&#x2019;m not at all sure I want to give that up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Sam, he seem like he pretty easy to get along with,&#x201d; Lillian commented as she greased three cake pans, then sprinkled flour in them. &#x201c;I doubt he pull on that knot too much. &#x2019;Sides, he tied up, too. Least, the man s&#x2019;posed to be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and isn&#x2019;t that the trouble?&#x201d; I pushed aside the hand towels, folded, stacked, and ready for the linen closet. &#x201c;Everybody expects a wife to toe the line, but a husband? I tell you, Lillian, the only change marriage makes in a man&#x2019;s life is he gets his food cooked and his laundry done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know as I&#x2019;d go that far,&#x201d; she said, as she poured the batter into the cake pans, then shook each pan so the layers would bake evenly. &#x201c;&#x2019;Course, I jus&#x2019; look at other folkses&#x2019; marriage, not mine. &#x2019;Cause you hit the nail on the head when it come to mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Lillian,&#x201d; I said, just done in by all the decisions that were piling up, waiting for me to get to them. Well, actually only one decision, but from that all the others would flow. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know that I want to marry anyone again, much less have to decide where to live when, if, I do.&#x201d; I rested my head on my hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than I want to deal with.&#x201d;</p><p>I lifted my head then, as more thoughts on the subject jumped up in my mind. &#x201c;You know, it used to be that where a couple lived was never a question. The man decided, and that was it. The woman was expected to pull up stakes, leave her family and friends and everything else and go wherever he said. And be happy about it, too.&#x201d; I bit my lip, remembering my own wretched experience. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it was ever even discussed when Wesley Lloyd proposed to me and, Lord knows, it didn&#x2019;t occur to me to question whatever he said. I took it for granted that I&#x2019;d leave my home and move into his. Not that I wanted to stay home, but still.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think that what the Bible tell a woman to do,&#x201d; Lillian said. She opened the oven door and arranged the pans on a rack, the heat making her brown arms glisten with perspiration.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;re wrong, because it&#x2019;s the other way around,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It says a <i>husband</i> should leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife.&#x201d; She and I looked at each other, as we both recalled that while I&#x2019;d done my share of cleaving to Wesley Lloyd, he&#x2019;d done a good bit of his to somebody else.</p><p>But turning my mind back to the current problem, since Wesley Lloyd was dead and gone, I&#x2019;d been up one side and down the other over it, and I still couldn&#x2019;t decide. Hazel Marie&#x2019;d said she knew exactly what I ought to do, but her mind was filled with one romantic notion after another, so I wasn&#x2019;t a bit surprised by where she stood. Then she&#x2019;d gotten serious and said, &#x201c;Miss Julia, all you have to do is decide what <i>you</i> want, then just do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Well, of course that was the crux of the matter. I didn&#x2019;t know what I wanted&#x2014;whether to marry again and run the risk of another betrayal or to stay a single widow and run my life the way I wanted to. I don&#x2019;t mind saying it&#x2014;I had thoroughly enjoyed doing just that the past few years since laying Wesley Lloyd in his grave, especially since I had free rein of half of his sizeable estate, Little Lloyd being the beneficiary of the other half.</p><p>Actually, I&#x2019;d hardly ever made a decision based purely on my own wants. There&#x2019;d always been responsibilites and obligations to other people that came into play and, as I am of a generous nature, I usually bowed to whatever somebody else wanted.</p><p>So, ever since Sam had come up with the idea of us marrying, I&#x2019;d been keeping myself busy, trying not to think about it in hopes that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to give him a final answer. I didn&#x2019;t want to lose him, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure I wanted him full-time, either. The fact of the matter was, I was about half mad that he hadn&#x2019;t left things as they were. But, no, he had to bring up something that put my life in turmoil.</p><p>Well, Lord knows, he&#x2019;d hinted around about it long enough, but when he finally got serious, the actual thought of being his wife, with all that that entailed, made my heart leap inside my chest. But I&#x2019;d answered with my head, and my head said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t rock the boat.&#x201d; Still, he&#x2019;d kept on and on at me, telling me I&#x2019;m not getting off the hook, that he&#x2019;s a patient man and sooner or later I&#x2019;m going to give in and make him a happy man. And to tell the truth, the upshot of it all put me on edge so bad I could hardly stand it. I&#x2019;ve prided myself on being a fairly decisive woman, but the agitation and indecision I&#x2019;d been under made me ready to bite somebody&#x2019;s head off.</p><p>The one thing that did tempt me, though, was Sam&#x2019;s ability to make me laugh, which I did whenever he started rattling off his many admirable qualities. I don&#x2019;t think Wesley Lloyd made me laugh even once during all the years of our dour marriage. He made me frown a lot, cry on too many occasions, and nurse a sorrowful heart all the time.</p><p>Lord, I never thought I&#x2019;d even consider such a thing as marrying again. Once you&#x2019;ve done it and suffered from it, you&#x2019;re not all that anxious to get back into a similar situation. Of course, Sam was not Wesley Lloyd Springer, not by a long shot. I&#x2019;d gone into marriage with Wesley Lloyd without an inkling that such a respected pillar of the church and the community could&#x2019;ve ever done what he did&#x2014;which was to enter into more than a decade of dalliance with Hazel Marie Puckett, produce a son and heir, and leave me to clean up the mess he left and end up with both mistress and son living under my roof. And if you think that&#x2019;s a strange arrangement, you wouldn&#x2019;t be the only one. But by this time I&#x2019;d come too far to let what other people think bother me. Lillian says I&#x2019;ll have stars in my crown for doing it, and I don&#x2019;t doubt it, even though it hasn&#x2019;t been as hard as I&#x2019;d feared or as one might think.</p><p>Still and all, I&#x2019;m stuck with the conviction that men, as a general rule, can&#x2019;t be trusted as far as you can throw them. And I speak from painful experience.</p><p>I raised my head as I heard Hazel Marie&#x2019;s car pull in the driveway and, in a few minutes, she came through the back door, shrugging out of her raincoat. It was a wonder to me how much better she looked the older she got. Not that she was all that old, forty-something being an enviable age from my vantage point, but I&#x2019;m talking about comparisions to what she looked like before she had the wherewithal to purchase suitable clothes and have her hair professionally done. Which was what she&#x2019;d been doing that morning.</p><p>I smiled at her as she stuck her umbrella in the stand. &#x201c;Your hair looks very nice, Hazel Marie.&#x201d; And it did, the highlighted streaks of blonde on blonde shone in the overhead kitchen lights. &#x201c;Velma is finally learning how to do it right.&#x201d;</p><p>Hazel Marie pulled out a chair at the table and immediately began to fold towels, since I&#x2019;d fallen down on the job. &#x201c;Miss Julia, you&#x2019;ll never believe what I heard at the beauty parlor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no telling. What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, oh, I&#x2019;m sorry, Lillian,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even speak to you, which just shows how stunned I am. I&#x2019;m so full of the latest gossip that I can&#x2019;t think of anything else.&#x201d;</p><p>Lillian laughed, her gold tooth flashing. &#x201c;Gossip do that to you sometime. &#x2019;Specially if it real good gossip.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, this is as good as it gets.&#x201d; Hazel Marie took a deep breath, trying to calm herself before imparting her news. &#x201c;Miss Julia, guess who&#x2019;s having an affair.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any idea and, Hazel Marie, if you heard it at Velma&#x2019;s, you ought to consider the source.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I do, but everybody&#x2019;s talking about it. I mean, out loud and everything. This wasn&#x2019;t something whispered and speculated about. It was told as a fact, because she&#x2019;s been seen coming out of the Mountaintop Motel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, my word,&#x201d; I said, drawn into the story in spite of my natural aversion to gossip, having suffered considerable anguish myself from wagging tongues. &#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p><p>Hazel Marie leaned across the table, smiling with the assurance that she was going to shock me good. &#x201c;Miss High and Mighty, Norma Cantrell, herself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I reared back in my chair, suitably shocked. Norma Cantrell was our Presbyterian pastor&#x2019;s secretary, and she ran his office like a third world dictator. I&#x2019;d never had much use for her, but the pastor thought she hung the moon. &#x201c;That can&#x2019;t be true.&#x201d; Then I thought about it, rubbing my fingers across my mouth. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As sure as I can be. It was Mildred Allen who saw her at the Mountaintop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I say.&#x201d; That iced the cake for me, until I thought of something else. &#x201c;And what was Mildred Allen doing there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Collecting for some fund or another,&#x201d; Hazel Marie said. &#x201c;She had to go twice. They kept putting her off and still didn&#x2019;t donate a thing. That&#x2019;s a pretty ratty motel, from what I hear. A perfect getaway place if you don&#x2019;t want people to know what you&#x2019;re doing or who you&#x2019;re doing it with. Of course, Norma didn&#x2019;t expect anybody she knew to be there. Velma said that Mildred said she didn&#x2019;t think Norma saw her because she hid behind a laurel bush when Norma came out of one of the rooms. And not once, but both times Mildred was there.&#x201d; Hazel Marie stopped and thought about it. &#x201c;I expect it was a pretty big laurel bush, considering Mildred&#x2019;s size. But, anyway, Norma thinks it&#x2019;s still a secret.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, now, Hazel Marie, there could be a perfectly innocent explanation, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe she has a sick friend.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At a place like that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It does sound suspicious, and I&#x2019;ll admit I&#x2019;m not all that surprised. Norma&#x2019;s always struck me as having more going on underneath than she lets on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Hazel Marie said, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s hard to imagine that she&#x2019;d get involved in a seedy affair since she&#x2019;s so particular about everything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Norma&#x2019;s been divorced almost all her life,&#x201d; I told her, as Lillian came to the table with cups and the coffee pot. She liked a little spate of gossip as well as the next person. &#x201c;The way I heard it, she married right out of high school, but hardly a year later, her husband ran off with their next-door neighbor. Norma&#x2019;s been living off sympathy ever since. People think her heart was broken and that she&#x2019;ll never recover, but this just goes to show, doesn&#x2019;t it? So who is she supposed to be seeing at the Mountaintop?&#x201d;</p><p>Hazel Marie smiled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never guess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just tell me, Hazel Marie,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine who&#x2019;d even be interested in her. Her husband certainly wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, nobody knows for sure, but the Honorable Clifford Beebee was mentioned. Can you believe that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My word,&#x201d; I said again, mumbling it this time as I tried to absorb this turn of events. &#x201c;If this gets out, Clifford Beebee&#x2019;s political career is over in this town. To say nothing of his marriage, because I don&#x2019;t believe Gladys&#x2019;ll put up with it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sound like to me it already got out,&#x201d; Lillian said, as she stirred sugar into her coffee. &#x201c;But that man been mayor so long, he pro&#x2019;bly think he b&#x2019;long there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right about that, Lillian,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s been willing to run against him for ever so long, so he probably thinks he can get away with anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, not this time,&#x201d; Hazel Marie said. &#x201c;Because I heard that Bill Denby&#x2019;s going to go up against him in the primary this spring. You know him, don&#x2019;t you? He&#x2019;s the service manager at the Chevrolet dealership. Somebody said his campaign slogan&#x2019;s going to be &#x2018;Fix It and Run It,&#x2019; which is what he says the town needs, just like a car. Mayor Beebee just might get taken down a notch or two, considering how high-handed he is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I should say, high-handed. Why, it&#x2019;s gotten so that none of the commissioners dares do anything without his say-so. At least, that&#x2019;s what I hear. I&#x2019;m not all that politically minded, myself. But what I want to know is why the mayor&#x2019;s name is being linked to Norma&#x2019;s? Did Mildred see him, too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, but she saw his car,&#x201d; Hazel Marie said, her eyes dancing with the image that produced. &#x201c;You know that big ole thing he drives? You can&#x2019;t miss it, and everybody knows it. It was parked right outside the room, and Velma said that Mildred said that she waited as long as she could after Norma left to see if he&#x2019;d come out of the room, too. But she had to go to the bathroom real bad and couldn&#x2019;t wait any longer.</p><p>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; Hazel Marie went on, a smile playing around her mouth. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t heard it all yet.&#x201d; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can stand much more. What else are they saying under the hair dryers?&#x201d;</p><p>She put her hand on my arm and said, &#x201c;Now, I&#x2019;m not sure I believe this, but here goes. When Velma was combing me out, she whispered that there&#x2019;s talk going around about <i>Emma Sue Ledbetter</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>What!</i> With the mayor?&#x201d; I was stunned, having no idea that the mayor was man enough for two women plus his wife.</p><p>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; Hazel Marie said, patting my arm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve changed subjects.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said with some relief that our preacher&#x2019;s wife was not linked with another man. &#x201c;Thank goodness.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew that Emma Sue would no more make herself a topic of this kind of gossip than she would fly. Although, as I thought about it, she had been trying out her wings a little here lately.</p><p>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; Hazel Marie went on, &#x201c;Norma&#x2019;s got the mayor all tied up. At least, I guess she has. A few other names were mentioned in connection with hers, so nobody knows for sure who all she&#x2019;s catting around with. But what I wanted to tell you is that Velma said that Emma Sue made an appointment to have a complete makeover. And I&#x2019;m talking hair color, makeup, everything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I scrunched up a bath towel in my hands, unable to believe what I was hearing. &#x201c;Hazel Marie, that is more unbelievable than Norma Cantrell traipsing around in a motel room. Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Velma showed me her appointment book because I couldn&#x2019;t believe it myself. And there it was, Emma Sue Ledbetter, Thursday at seven P.M. Velma&#x2019;s doing her a favor by taking her after hours, so nobody&#x2019;ll be there with her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pour...</p></p><h2>The Mueller Report: The Final Report of the Special Counsel into Donald Trump, Russia, and Collusion</h2><p><b>NOW A <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i>, <i>WASHINGTON POST</i>,&nbsp;<i>WALL STREET JOURNAL</i>, <i>USA TODAY</i>, AND<i> PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</i> BESTSELLER.</b><br><br><b>There has never been a more important political investigation than&nbsp;Robert S.

Robert Mueller, a lifelong Republican, has concluded his investigation and submitted its findings to Attorney General William Barr. Barr has told Congress that Mueller found no proof of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and did not come to a conclusion on obstruction of justice&#x2014;neither concluding the president committed a crime nor exonerating him. But Mueller&#x2019;s report was over 300 pages and Barr&#x2019;s summary was only four pages, raising questions about the conclusions of a historic investigation.<br><br> Special Counsel Robert Mueller III&#x2019;s probe into Russian influence on the 2016 election of Donald Trump&#x2014;including links between the campaign and Russian interests, obstruction of justice by President Trump, and any other matters that may have arisen in the course of the investigation&#x2014;has been the focal point of American politics since its inception in May 2017.&nbsp;<br><br> Democrats in the US House of Representatives hoped to use the report to begin impeachment proceedings, with the support of those critical of the president. Media tracked Mueller&#x2019;s every move, and the investigation was subject to constant speculation by political pundits everywhere. It resulted in the indictments of Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and many others. President Trump and his supporters affirmed that the investigation was a &#x201c;witch hunt&#x201d; and the product of a plot by the political establishment&#x2014;the &#x201c;deep state&#x201d;&#x2014;to delegitimize his presidency.<br><br> Mueller&#x2019;s findings&#x2014;at least according to Barr&#x2014;allowed the latter to claim victory. But now, thanks to a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler for the full report, a resolution from the House of Representatives to release the full report to the public (though blocked in the Senate by Mitch McConnell), and popular demand, it&#x2019;s time for public to judge if that is true.<br><br> The Mueller investigation will join Watergate, and the Mueller Report will join&nbsp;the 9/11 Commission Report, the Warren Report, and the Starr Report, as one of the most important in history.&nbsp;<i>The Mueller Report </i>is required reading for everyone with interest in American politics, for every 2016 and 2020 voter, and every American. It&#x2019;s now available here as an affordable paperback, featuring an introduction from eminent civil libertarian, Harvard Law Professor&nbsp;Emeritus, and <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Alan Dershowitz, who provides a constitutional, civil law-based commentary sorely needed in today&#x2019;s media landscape.</p><p><b>Alan Dershowitz</b>&nbsp;is one of the most famous and celebrated lawyers in America. He was the youngest full professor in Harvard Law School history, where he is now the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Emeritus. Dershowitz is the author of numerous bestselling books, including the&nbsp;<i>New York Times </i>bestseller&nbsp;<i>The Case Against Impeaching Trump.&nbsp;</i><br><br><b>Robert S. Mueller III</b>&nbsp;is the special counsel of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any other matters that arise from his findings. He served as director of the FBI from 2001 to 2013. Mueller, a registered Republican, had dedicated his life to public service and has assembled a decorated criminal justice career. He also&nbsp;served as a Marine in the Vietnam War, and received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star for heroism.&nbsp;<br><br> The <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> has a mission to enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.&#x201c;The Mueller report is that rare Washington tell-all that surpasses its pre-publication hype...the best book by far on the workings of the Trump presidency. It was delivered to the attorney general but is also written for history. The book reveals the president in all his impulsiveness, insecurity and growing disregard for rules and norms; White House aides alternating between deference to the man and defiance of his &#x2018;crazy s---&#x2018; requests; and a campaign team too inept to realize, or too reckless to care, when they might have been bending the law. And special counsel Robert Mueller has it all under oath, on the record, along with interviews and contemporaneous notes backing it up.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Carlos Lozada,&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> &#x201c;This is a document that, like the Badlands National Park, one has to visit for oneself. If you rely on the velvet fog of Attorney General William Barr&#x2019;s Cliffs Notes, you will get an &#x2018;F&#x2019; on the exam... So much of what&#x2019;s in the Mueller report is already known, thanks to what never again should be referred to as &#x2018;fake news,&#x2019; that reading it is like consuming a short story collection that&#x2019;s already been excerpted in every magazine you subscribe to.

Michael Smith draws on phenomenological resources and hermeneutic dialogue to explore the affinities and distinctions between shamanism and Jungian psychology, both rooted ultimately in a heart-centered way if life, and both having highly intricate maps of the human psychic interiors. As the reader adventures through this book he or she will encounter shamanic initiation, dismemberments, disassociation, grief, despair, and soul loss, the healing power of ritual, ecstasy and other altered states. The book explores many rich topics including the role of talismans and amulets, the various levels of the collective unconscious, the archetypal and imaginable perspectives on such phenomena, and implications for psychotherapeutic practice today. In the new preface, the author argues that in the end "It isn't the fascinating and powerful techniques that are the essential thing, but the person inside, its capacity to live from the heart n Earth-honoring and Nature- attuning ways that is the essential center of the Jung/shamanism interface." <p></p> <b>In Jung and Shamanism in Dialogue</b>, C. Michael Smith has written a "must have" classic for all students of shamanism and Jungian psychology. Thorough, clear and authoritative, Smith writes from first-hand perspective, drawing on his own depth experiences in studying and teaching shamanism and Jungian psychology for decades. As in his previous book, Psychotherapy and the Sacred, he is psychological and spiritual, phenomenological and historical in his unique perspective. Jung was often described as a "shaman" by those who knew him well, but few have had the courage to openly make this claim, and none has presented the case as thoroughly as Smith has. This new preface to this second edition adds a richness of wisdom worth the price of the book. <p></p> -Tess Castleman, Training Analyst, The C.G. Jung Institute, Zurich <p></p></p><p><p> C.

Thirty-nine &#x2013; a coincidence not lost on Chip when he discovers the number of bolts in that basement door. Meanwhile, Emily finds herself wondering about the women in this sparsely populated White Mountain village &#x2013; self-proclaimed herbalists &#x2013; and their interest in her fifth-grade daughters. Are the women mad? Or is it her husband, in the wake of the tragedy, whose grip on sanity has become desperately tenuous?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The result is a poignant and powerful ghost story with all the hallmarks readers have come to expect from bestselling novelist Chris Bohjalian: a palpable sense of place, an unerring sense of the demons that drive us, and characters we care about deeply. <br><br>The difference this time? Some of those characters are dead.</p><p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Justin Cronin on <em>The Night Strangers</em> by Chris Bohjalian</strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <em><strong>Justin Cronin</strong> is the bestselling author of </em>The Passage<em>, as well as </em>Mary and O'Neil<em>, which won the Pen/Hemingway Award and the Stephen Crane Prize, and </em>The Summer Guest.<p></p> <p>To put the matter succinctly: The first chapter of Chris Bohjalian&#x2019;s <em>The Night Strangers</em> is so riveting, I dropped the book in the tub.</p> <p>I spent the next half-hour running a hair-dryer over its soaked pages. By the time the task was complete the book was as swollen as a Reuben sandwich. It was clear to me that if the first twenty pages were any indication, I&#x2019;d better read the rest somewhere safe and secure, with neither water nor fire, and while I was at it, some good soundproofing, lest I freak out my children by shrieking like an acrophobe on a roller coaster.</p> <p>I wasn&#x2019;t wrong.</p> <p>Describing Bohjalian&#x2019;s thirteenth novel isn&#x2019;t a simple matter. Its dovetailing plots are so seamlessly interwoven--as tightly screwed together as the thirty-nine carriage bolts sealing the mysterious door in the Linton&#x2019;s (very creepy) basement--I don&#x2019;t want to give too much away.</p> <p>But it&#x2019;s also a challenge to summarize because <em>The Night Strangers</em> is so many novels at once, as all good novels must be. It&#x2019;s a psychological thriller. It&#x2019;s a domestic drama, the story of a family coping with the aftermath of dislocation and disaster. It&#x2019;s a book about a specifically American locale, in this case a small town in a remote corner of New Hampshire. It&#x2019;s a classic New England ghost story, and a hell of a good one. (It also won&#x2019;t make you want to get on an airplane anytime soon, though there I go, telling too much.)</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve been following Bohjalian for some time. Always I&#x2019;ve come away from his novels replete with admiration--and not a little envy--for his skill and versatility, book after book. His psychological acumen is downright Flaubert-esque, most notably (and remarkably) in his creation of female characters. But Bohjalian is a reader-friendly writer, too. His novels are compulsively discussable, the kinds of tales that employ specific human dramas to probe larger ethical issues. They make you think. They are, in every sense, &#x201c;what would you do?&#x201d; books, and the answers are never simple.</p> <p>If there&#x2019;s a core to Bohjalian&#x2019;s work, though, it&#x2019;s the cultural divide between the modern scientific world and--for lack of a better term--the spiritual world and its ancient practices. His novels are populated by the likes of dowsers (<em>Water Witches</em>), the practitioners of traditional female-assisted birth (<em>Midwives</em>), homeopaths (<em>The Law of Similars</em>), even a shape-shifter (<em>Trans-Sister Radio</em>).</p> <p><em>The Night Strangers</em> follows this tradition, but with a dark twist. The witches of Bethel, New Hampshire are decidedly of the sinister variety&#x2014;albeit more likely to sell real estate and wear stylish leather skirts than fly around on brooms and don pointy hats. Beneath the town&#x2019;s charming rural surface of gingerbread Victorians, maple sugarhouses, and fiery foliage lurks a conspiracy of evil reminiscent of Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x2019;s &#x201c;Young Goodman Brown.&#x201d; How evil? Suffice it to say that when somebody drops by to welcome newcomers to the neighborhood with a plate of vegan brownies, they should think twice before taking the first bite.</p> <p>But to say anything more would be to reveal too much. Fans of his fiction, as I am, will know <em>The Night Strangers</em> is pure Bohjalian. Newcomers will come away wanting more. And if you read it in the bathtub, consider yourself warned.</p> <p></p>&nbsp;<br>CHRIS BOHJALIAN is the critically acclaimed author of fourteen books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Double Bind,</i> <i>Secrets of Eden,</i> and <i>Skeletons at the Feast.</i> His novel, <i>Midwives</i>, was a number one <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and a selection of Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club.

Before dawn on November 5, 1989, Betty Broderick got into her car and drove over to the house in San Diego of her lawyer ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, and his new wife, Linda. Arriving at 5:30 a.m., she used a key that she had obtained from one of her children to enter the house by a back door and climbed the stairs to Dan and Linda&#x2019;s bedroom. Five shots rang out in the dark, three hitting their targets. Linda died instantly. Dan lingered on for several minutes. As he tried to call for help, Betty stamped on his hand and tore the phone from the wall. The prosecution claimed it was as about as clear a case of premeditated murder as anyone could imagine. Betty claimed she had gone over to the house to talk to Dan - or maybe to commit suicide in front of him - but when someone shouted, &#x2018;Call the police&#x2019;, she got flustered and started firing. Betty Broderick was acquitted of first degree murder in her second trial but found guilty of second degree murder. To some, Betty Broderick is virtually the patron saint of the sanctity of marriage, executing her abusive, cheating husband and his &#x2018;nineteen year old college dropout of a Polack whore&#x2019; (actually Linda was twenty-eight, a college graduate and a professional paralegal). To others, Dan Broderick suffered his wife&#x2019;s abuse of him for fourteen years of marriage, left her well provided for and then married the love of his life, only to be continually stalked for seven years, to have Betty repeatedly incite his children to kill him and Linda, to find her driving her car through the front door of his new house, and then to be murdered in the coldest of blood. Bella Stumbo&#x2019;s account of the Dan, Linda and Betty Broderick affair is encyclopedic and definitive, and &#x2018;Until the Twelfth of Never&#x2019; was a runaway international bestseller when it was first published twenty years ago, as well as winning an Edgar Award. Bello Stumbo herself died in 2002, so was not alive to cover Betty Broderick&#x2019;s parole hearing in 2010, a short account of which is included in this book. Dan Broderick, Linda Broderick and Betty Broderick &#x2013; saints or sinners? Betty Broderick &#x2013; sane or insane? Read &#x2018;Until the Twelfth of Never&#x2019; and you will certainly have an opinion.

It describes and depicts in detail how seventeenth-century English, French, Dutch, and other European trading ships and warships were rigged from stem to stern throughout this colorful period in maritime history.<br>The book begins in 1600, the earliest date of our detailed knowledge of ships&#x2019; rigging, and the earliest to which that characteristic seventeenth-century fitting, the spritsail topmast, has been traced. It ends in 1720, roughly the time when the spritsail topmast was superseded by the jib boom and other innovations of eighteenth-century rigging. The book&#x2019;s 12 chapters cover every aspect of the ship&#x2019;s rigging of the period, from the lower masts and bowsprit to the running rigging of the topsails and topgallants. Over 350 fine line drawings illustrate every item used in the rigging. Twenty-five halftones, extensively annotated, illustrate typical ships that plied the seas in the days of the bowsprit mast &#x2014; English merchantmen and gun ships, French and Dutch men-of-war, and more.<br>In compiling this volume, R. C. Anderson consulted not only the literature of the period, listed in the extensive bibliography, but also famous ship models created throughout the seventeenth century &#x2014; some with contemporary rigging in almost perfect condition. The result is an indispensable resource for model builders, maritime historians, sailing ship buffs &#x2014; anyone interested in authentic documentation of ships&#x2019; rigging during a crucial period in the history of sailing vessels.</p><p></p><h2>Sunflower Summer: God Gives Us Friends When We Need to Wait (Tales of Buttercup Grove)</h2><p><b>Sunflower Summer</b>&nbsp;is one of four books in the Tales of Buttercup Grove early reader series.<br><br>When Raccoon cleans his garden shed, he finds seven giant sunflower seeds--just enough for him and his friends.

With his son, John Henry Williams, he devoted his final years to the sports memorabilia business, even as illness overtook him.

Montville, who was a sports columnist for the <i>Boston Globe</i> and then a senior writer for <i>Sports Illustrated</i> is an admitted Red Sox and Williams fanatic, and his passion for his hero rings clearly from every page, along with his clear baseball expertise. But Montville does not hide Williams's flaws. The young Williams was temperamental and justified bad behavior with batting prowess that could excuse just about anything. Quick to anger, "the Kid" had a gift for foul language, too. <p> Montville's study offers insides accounts of Williams's obsessive development as a hitter and his constant struggle to perfect his swing (mistakenly called "natural" by sports writers with little understanding of his extensive preparation). The chapter on 1941, perhaps the greatest year in his career, draws on research and interviews never before published. Montville lets whole passages stand uninterrupted--from Williams's manager, Joe Cronin, from his teammate Dom DiMaggio, and from other players and baseball officials who tell the story of Williams's quest for a .400 batting average. The tale of the final day of the season (when he refused to be benched and went six for eight in a double header to jump from .39955 to his final total, .406) is as pulse-pounding as any thriller. </p><p> Alongside its essential focus on Williams's baseball life, the book also delves into his military service during both World War II and the Korean War, his passion for sports fishing, and his commitment to helping children through the Jimmy Fund. Finally, Montville devotes a chapter to the controversy after Williams's death, exposing the back-and-forth among Williams's heirs in the bizarre decision to freeze his body in a cryogenic warehouse in Scottsdale, Arizona. </p><p> Montville's biography makes a good case that Williams was, if not the greatest hitter ever to play the game, certainly among them. For his focused, scientific approach to hitting, Williams is unmatched in the history of the game. His life, marred perhaps by a temper and occasional immaturity that soured his reputation in Boston, is one of true sports greatness. Early in the book, Montville argues that Williams is less appreciated today than he might be because he played out most of his 19-year career in the era before televised highlights. But with Montville's efforts to capture first-hand accounts of Williams's achievements, The Splendid Splinter's legacy is assured. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>He was The Kid. The Splendid Splinter. Teddy Ballgame. One of the greatest figures of his generation, and arguably the greatest baseball hitter of all time. But what made Ted Williams a legend - and a lightning rod for controversy in life and in death? What motivated him to interrupt his Hall of Fame career "twice to serve his country as a fighter pilot; to embrace his fans while tangling with the media; to retreat from the limelight whenever possible into his solitary love of fishing; and to become the most famous man ever to have his body cryogenically frozen after his death? "New York Times bestselling author Leigh Montville, who wrote the celebrated "Sports Illustrated obituary of Ted Williams, now delivers an intimate, riveting account of this extraordinary life. <br>Still a gangly teenager when he stepped into a Boston Red Sox uniform in 1939, Williams's boisterous personality and penchant for towering home runs earned him adoring admirers--the fans--and venomous critics--the sportswriters. In 1941, the entire country followed Williams's stunning .406 season, a record that has not been touched in over six decades. At the pinnacle of his prime, Williams left Boston to train and serve as a fighter pilot in World War II, missing three full years of baseball. He was back in 1946, dominating the sport alongside teammates Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Bobby Doerr.

Whitfield is actively involved in the profession, and has been teaching for over 20 years. He is currently an instructor at Southwest Acupuncture College, in Boulder, CO. In addition, he lectures in the U.S., Canada, and Europe on sports medicine acupuncture. Chad Bong, MS, L.Ac. is a nationally certified acupuncturist and holds a Master&#39;s degree in Exercise Science. He is a contributing writer to The Acupuncture Handbook. Chad is a lifelong athlete, and he combines acupuncture with western sports medicine and fitness training.Because musculoskeletal pain is a commonly seen syndrome for acupuncturists, Whitfield Reaves s publication, The Acupuncture Handbook of Sports Injuries and Pain, is a must have for all practitioners regardless of their specialty. It is refreshing to see a book formatted based on techniques that have been clinically proven to work based on the authors 25 years of experience. The Acupuncture Handbook of Sports Injuries and Pain, is a well-illustrated, resourceful and easy-to-use handbook covering simple assessment techniques and treatment of 25 common musculoskeletal injuries. Using the meridian systems, motor points and trigger points along with specific needle techniques, the reader will be able to quickly apply the information presented into clinical treatment. --Matt Callison, L.Ac.<br><br>This is an extraordinary book. Whitfield, whom I have known for almost 25 years, has summed up his vast experience and technical innovation of treating soft tissue injury into a remarkably easy to use, step-by-step, handbook. His book addresses 25 common injuries and pain patterns affecting the following: the heel, foot, leg, knee, thigh, hip, lower back, hand, elbow, shoulder and neck. If we look at the nine-page chapter on Frozen Shoulder, we get an idea of Whitfield s organization. First, a one-page summation of Diagnosis and Assessment. Then, on a single page in outline form is Summary of the Injury, which includes Clinical Features, Common Patient Complaints, Differentiation from Similar Injuries and Conditions, and Typical Medical Recommendations. Following, in short outline form, is Treatment and Techniques, with an Overview and Prognosis. For each chapter, Whitfield then leads the practitioner through his four step protocol. For Frozen Shoulder, in Step One (Initial Treatment), he offers four techniques, including the tendino-muscle meridians, contra-lateral treatment, opposite extremity treatment, and empirical points. The practitioner may choose from any and all of these techniques. Included are special needle techniques and comments for each of his recommendations. Step Two offers treatments based on meridians and microsystems, such as shu-stream point combinations, xi-cleft, extraordinary meridians, and auricular therapy. This includes rationalization and degree of predicable success. Step Three addresses possible underlying zang-fu imbalances and their need for treatment. Step Four offers detailed examination of important local and ah shi points relevant to the injury. Anyone who has studied with Whitfield, or has been his patient, observes several things. Foremost, his treatments are remarkably effective. He often tells patients that he expects recovery within three treatments. Secondly, Whit's genius is his knowledge of local and distal palpatory points that are critical to success; few books reveal these points or Whitfield s unique needle technique. Third, his knowledge of local anatomy allows for point combinations that take into account local innervation, origin and insertion of muscles, and the relationship of ligaments and tendons to the injury. He is truly a master of his art, and this mastery is well articulated in The Acupuncture Handbook of Sports Injuries and Pain. This book is so beautifully organized, with excellent illustrations of local anatomy, that it is very easy to use. For serious practitioners specializing in pain and trauma, The Acupuncture Handbook of Sports Injuries and Pain will quickly become their most valued authoritative clinical guide. --Jake Fratkin, OMD, L.Ac.</p><h2>The Vet&#39;s Daughter (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><i>The Vet's Daughter</i> combines shocking realism with a visionary edge.

Comyns wrote her first book,&nbsp;<i>Sisters by the River</i>&nbsp;(1947), a series of sketches based on her childhood, while living in the country to escape the Blitz, which is also when she made an initial sketch for&nbsp;<i>The Vet&#x2019;s Daughter</i>.

His series for Marvel,&nbsp;X-Men: Grand Design, was released in 2017 to wide acclaim.&#x201c;Piskor&#x2019;s ongoing series of oversize albums detailing the history of hip-hop is one of the very best things about contemporary comics-making.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Austin 360</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In the fourth helping of Piskor's chronology of his passion, covering 1984-85, Philadelphia is the scene as often a NYC and LA, and the impact on pop culture of Philly's explosive suppression of the African American MOVE commune is explained via flashback.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ray Olson, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Piskor's innovative use of color makes things crackle and sputter.

If he were merely a historian writing about such a vital period, it would be enticing enough. Scouring books, blogs, podcasts, Youtube and anything else to pinpoint hundreds of moments of time for each volume, the legwork Mr. Piskor puts into accurately presenting this history is legendary. But at his core, Mr. Piskor is a powerful visual artist. The style he established in the very first volume continues to grab the viewer. He exaggerates just the right parts of his chosen characters with a technique that intentionally celebrates both the Marvel Comics&#x2019; artists of the 1970s, as well as one of Mr.Piskor&#x2019;s idols, underground comic artist R.

But few know that she also received many revelations from the Blessed Virgin Mary and enjoyed a special relationship with her. Now, in Purest of All Lilies, a prominent Marian priest with a background in Mariology explores St. Faustina's rich relationship with Mary from her love of Mary growing up in Poland to the many Diary passages that she devoted to the Mother of God when she was a nun.<br> <br> The reader learns how St. Faustina's father would begin each day singing prayers to the Blessed Virgin and of the family's special May and October devotions to the Mother of God. At the early age of five, the future saint would tell her mother of dreams she had in which she walked hand-in-hand with the Blessed Virgin in a beautiful garden.<br> <br> Along with St. Faustina's early devotion to Mary, the author shows us how the Blessed Mother taught her as a nun important lessons about suffering, purity of heart and humility. Perhaps most fascinating of all, this Marian priest analyses the poems that St. Faustina wrote about Mary and the metaphors she used to describe the Blessed Virgin, including flowers such as the lily, the rose and the violet. <br> <br></p><p>Fr.

He&#x2019;s also just a fascinating guy, with his interest in pickle literature and matter-of-fact use of red rollerskates to get around, and his quirks help explain what Mouse, who&#x2019;s more a narrative catalyst than a co-star, gets out of the friendship. Denton&#x2019;s assured understanding of these character warms her watercolor art, with Bear&#x2019;s operatic poses (he has a particularly nice line in histrionic leaning) humorously incongruous yet somehow graceful.

Lee. But he was also one of America&#x2019;s most divisive figures, a man whose entire career was steeped in controversy. Was he an avatar or an anachronism, a brilliant strategist or a vainglorious mountebank? Drawing on a wealth of new sources, Arthur Herman delivers a powerhouse biography that peels back the layers of myth&#x2014;both good and bad&#x2014;and exposes the marrow of the man beneath.<br><br> MacArthur&#x2019;s life spans the emergence of the United States Army as a global fighting force. Its history is to a great degree <i>his</i> story. The son of a Civil War hero, he led American troops in three monumental conflicts&#x2014;World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. Born four years after Little Bighorn, he died just as American forces began deploying in Vietnam. Herman&#x2019;s magisterial book spans the full arc of MacArthur&#x2019;s journey, from his elevation to major general at thirty-eight through his tenure as superintendent of West Point, field marshal of the Philippines, supreme ruler of postwar Japan, and beyond. More than any previous biographer, Herman shows how MacArthur&#x2019;s strategic vision helped shape several decades of U.S. foreign policy. Alone among his peers, he foresaw the shift away from Europe, becoming the prophet of America&#x2019;s destiny in the Pacific Rim.<br><br> Here, too, is a vivid portrait of a man whose grandiose vision of his own destiny won him enemies as well as acolytes. MacArthur was one of the first military heroes to cultivate his own public persona&#x2014;the swashbuckling commander outfitted with Ray-Ban sunglasses, riding crop, and corncob pipe. Repeatedly spared from being killed in battle&#x2014;his soldiers nicknamed him &#x201c;Bullet Proof&#x201d;&#x2014;he had a strong sense of divine mission. &#x201c;Mac&#x201d; was a man possessed, in the words of one of his contemporaries, of a &#x201c;supreme and almost mystical faith that he could not fail.&#x201d; Yet when he did, it was on an epic scale. His willingness to defy both civilian and military authority was, Herman shows, a lifelong trait&#x2014;and it would become his undoing. Tellingly, MacArthur once observed, &#x201c;Sometimes it is the order one disobeys that makes one famous.&#x201d;<br><br> To capture the life of such an outsize figure in one volume is no small achievement. With <i>Douglas&nbsp;MacArthur</i>, Arthur Herman has set a new standard for untangling the legacy of this American legend.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Douglas MacArthur</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is revisionist history at its best and, hopefully, will reopen a debate about the judgment of history and MacArthur&#x2019;s place in history.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>New York Journal of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Unfailingly evocative . . . close to an epic . . . More than a biography, it is a tale of a time in the past almost impossible to contemplate today as having taken place, with MacArthur himself as a figure perhaps too remote to understand, but all the more important to encounter.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New Criterion</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With<i> Douglas MacArthur: American Warrior</i>, the prolific and talented historian Arthur Herman has delivered an expertly rendered, compulsively readable account that does full justice to MacArthur&#x2019;s monumental achievements without slighting his equally monumental flaws.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Commentary</i></b></p><p><b>Arthur Herman</b> is the bestselling author of<i> The Cave and the Light,</i> <i>Freedom&#x2019;s Forge, How the Scots Invented the Modern World, The Idea of Decline in Western History, To Rule the Waves, </i>and<i> Gandhi &amp; Churchill,</i> which was a 2009 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Dr. Herman taught the Western Heritage Program at the Smithsonian&#x2019;s Campus on the Mall, and he has been a professor of history at Georgetown University, The Catholic University of America, George Mason University, and The University of the South at Sewanee.Chapter 1<br><br>Son of the Father<br><br>Nothing has stood longer than MacArthur, the hills, and the devil.<br><br>&#x2014;�Scottish proverb<br><br>Anyone who wants to understand the life and career of Douglas MacArthur needs to start by understanding the father.<br><br>There is a photograph of Arthur MacArthur standing by a chair in his Civil War uniform. It&#x2019;s a shock to realize we are looking at a lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He looks more like a boy in costume dress-�up, until you look at the face. Under the whiskerless cheeks still running to baby fat you can detect the hardness of granite in the mouth as well as in the eyes: a granite he would pass on to his son.<br><br>Arthur MacArthur was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on June 2, 1845. His father, also named Arthur, was a popular lawyer, as well as judge advocate for the militia in the state&#x2019;s Western Military District. Judge Arthur MacArthur Senior had migrated to Massachusetts from Scotland in 1828. In America his considerable intelligence and even more considerable charm had won him a series of increasingly lucrative jobs. In little time he rose from teacher in a one-�room school to law clerk in New York City. There he eventually opened his own law firm (in those days no one needed a formal law degree to pass the New York Bar) and found a wealthy wife, Aurelia Belcher, daughter of a Massachusetts iron manufacturer.1<br><br>Judge MacArthur, an accomplished storyteller and a delightful after-�dinner speaker, was a hard man to dislike. People were irresistibly drawn to the man with dark, hooded eyes, tousled black hair, and quaint Scottish burr. But all the charm and smoothness that made the judge&#x2019;s career a success stuck with him. What was left for his son, Arthur, was the same perceptive intelligence yoked to a ferocity&#x2014;�even a rigidity&#x2014;�of will and an emotional opaqueness that would characterize Arthur MacArthur&#x2019;s entire career.<br><br>That ferocity certainly got him through America&#x2019;s bloodiest war. He showed an unflinching heroism from his first battle at Perryville to Stones River in December 1862, and then to Missionary Ridge in November 1863, where he single-�handedly led the Twenty-�fourth Wisconsin up the steep slopes under heavy fire, carrying the regimental flag and shouting, &#x201c;On Wisconsin!,&#x201d; which would later become the state&#x2019;s motto.<br><br>From there MacArthur and the Twenty-�fourth would march south and fight on, along the long, bloody road to Atlanta, the hub of Confederate resistance in the west. He was still only eighteen when the regiment&#x2019;s commanding officer was wounded and he took over command of the regiment. It was on the eve of fierce fighting at Resaca on the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad line that passed through Atlanta&#x2014;�the first major hurdle in the North&#x2019;s bid to capture the transportation hub of the Confederacy, Atlanta itself.<br><br>Everyone realized this was no ordinary eighteen-�year-�old. MacArthur, a fellow officer in the Twenty-fourth Wisconsin named Ed Parsons, and a divisional staff officer were out examining the earthworks that the Wisconsin men had built to MacArthur&#x2019;s specifications. They looked sturdy enough, but the staff officer wondered if the Twenty-�fourth had enough personnel to man them if the Confederates launched a full-�scale attack. &#x201c;Major,&#x201d; he asked MacArthur, &#x201c;suppose the Rebs should make a charge and attempt to capture this position? What would you do?&#x201d;<br><br>MacArthur told him fiercely, &#x201c;Fight like hell.&#x201d;2<br><br>At the battle for Kennesaw Mountain, Major MacArthur took a bullet in the wrist and another in the chest, but miraculously continued to lead his troops in the fight, on to Peachtree Creek, and finally he and his men and the rest of the Army of the Cumberland marched into a smashed and deserted Atlanta. In 112 days the Army of the Cumberland had advanced 200 miles and fought thirteen major battles. It had cost the Twenty-�fourth Wisconsin eight officers and ninety-�two enlisted men killed and wounded&#x2014;�with the teenaged Arthur MacArthur in command almost all the way. 3<br><br>Three months later, while the rest of Sherman&#x2019;s army was marching south into Georgia, the Twenty-�fourth saw even tougher fighting at the Battle of Franklin near Nashville on November 30. There the nineteen-�year-�old&#x2019;s luck finally ran out. Two bullets, one in the knee and the other in the shoulder, finally laid him low in the battle that every survivor of the Twenty-�fourth agreed was the worst they had ever fought, worse even than Missionary Ridge. When the last Confederate attack petered out around 9:00 p.m., MacAr�thur&#x2019;s men loaded their critically wounded commander into an ambulance wagon while fires from the burning houses of Franklin lit up the night sky. His friend Ed Parsons was left in charge of the regiment while doctors struggled to save MacArthur&#x2019;s leg (they did), and found to their relief that the bullet in the shoulder had passed clean through.4<br><br>So it was a relatively light price to pay for the slaughter at Franklin. When Parsons went to visit MacArthur in the hospital that evening, he remembered finding four blood-�soaked generals lying side by side on the porch, all dead.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until mid-�February 1865 that Arthur finally returned to his regiment after recuperating at home in Milwaukee, where his mother had died shortly before he arrived. By now, most veterans of the Civil War were sick of the war, including his former commanding officer and the man who had coined the phrase &#x201c;war is hell,&#x201d; General William Tecumseh Sherman himself.<br><br>&#x201c;I confess without shame that I am tired of war,&#x201d; Sherman wrote to a friend. &#x201c;Its glory is all moonshine. . . . Only those who have not heard a shot, nor heard the shrills and groans of the wounded and lacerated (friend or foe) . . . cry aloud for more blood and more vengeance [and] more desolation.&#x201d;5 Another survivor of the same campaign, Lieutenant Oliver Wendell Holmes, had found the ordeal so shattering that he was never the same man again, even as Supreme Court justice.<br><br>Arthur MacArthur had the opposite experience. Far from being repelled by the violence, noise, and danger of war, he loved it, and he learned to close his mind and heart to the suffering it imposed. The supreme thrill of personally leading men through mortal peril to victory and glory would never leave him. In later years he came to wrap the experience of war and carnage around himself like an old friend&#x2014;�and he would pass that same thrill on to his son.<br><br>In April 1865 a beaten and battered Confederacy surrendered, and the Twenty-�fourth Wisconsin was able to return home on June 5. Arthur MacAr�thur, now a lieutenant colonel by order of the Wisconsin state legislature, led his men in a triumphal dress parade down the streets of Milwaukee, while his father, along with the mayor and other dignitaries, proudly watched from their grandstand seats. Five days later the Twenty-�fourth Wisconsin was officially disbanded, and Arthur was promoted to full colonel.<br><br>He was still not old enough to vote, but little more than a week after his twentieth birthday he was a war hero and a Wisconsin state legend. There was even talk of recommending him for the Medal of Honor for his bravery on Missionary Ridge. But the curtain of peacetime reality had now come down. Arthur MacArthur&#x2019;s dream was to remain in the army, but as the army had shrunk from a million men to fewer than 55,000, and from 15,000 officers to only 3,400&#x2014;�with thousands of other veterans clamoring for the handful of remaining vacancies&#x2014;�commands were few and very far between, even for a war hero.<br><br>So Judge MacArthur, the most popular man in Milwaukee and a growing power in Wisconsin state politics, got into the act. He wrote to his friend Alexander Randall, former Wisconsin governor and now postmaster general, to see if Randall could help get a promotion for young Arthur (the best the army could come up with for the former lieutenant colonel of the Twenty-fourth Wisconsin was second lieutenant in the Seventeenth Infantry, which was being reorganized in New York City). Randall obligingly spoke to President Andrew Johnson, as did a Wisconsin senator and the congressman for Milwaukee&#x2019;s district. On October 13, just as MacArthur&#x2019;s regiment had completed training and was setting out for Texas, Arthur MacArthur found himself promoted to captain.6<br><br>It was not the first time a MacArthur furthered his military career with the help of political patronage, and it would definitely not be the last. Both father and son firmly believed that in the making of a successful military career, there was no substitute for courage and competence and experience. In their long careers, both would display plenty of all three&#x2014;�plus the other attribute Napoleon said was indispensable for a great general, namely, luck. MacArthur father and son also believed they had a kind of genius, a destiny, that would inevitably bring them the rewards they deserved. But why wait and do nothing when a brief but well-�placed letter, a friendly meeting over lunch or after dinner, or a kind word from one powerful friend to another could help to speed up the inevitable?<br><br>&#x201c;This fortunate promotion,&#x201d; Arthur MacArthur wrote to Postmaster Randall, &#x201c;[may] decide my life. The undeveloped events of the future may place it in my power to reciprocate.&#x201d; Already he could see himself being in a position to one day return the favor.7<br><br>Arthur&#x2019;s unexpected promotion did ruffle some feathers in the Seventeenth Infantry. It turned out there were no vacancies for captains, certainly none for MacArthur; so Captain MacArthur was reassigned to the Thirty-�sixth Infantry instead, which was stationed in the Nebraska Territory, helping to protect Union Pacific Railroad crews building the Transcontinental Railroad from Indian attacks. It was not until November, however, that he reached the headquarters of the Thirty-�sixth Infantry and his first post&#x2013;�Civil War army post, Fort Kearny. He would have to wait twenty-�three long years before he would see his next promotion.<br><br>What followed for Arthur MacArthur were two decades in what would come to be called the Old Army, as he traveled from one far-�flung army post to another in a series of scenes that could have been from a John Ford movie: the wooden stockade guarding a small collection of whitewashed buildings clustered around a flagpole and a dusty parade ground; the tedious patrols and monotonous fatigue duties played out in front of endless stretches of prairie and sagebrush desert with sandstone cliffs or dark snowcapped mountains framing the horizon; occasional shots traded with disgruntled bands of Indians while a steady procession of Cheyenne, Sioux, Comanche, and Kiowa as well as buffalo, antelope, elk, and characters from future westerns&#x2014;�&#x201c;the unshaven buckskin-�clad frontiersman, the trapper, trader, trooper, and pioneer homeseeker&#x201d;&#x2014;�paraded past each post and each patrol, from Nebraska and Arkansas to Texas, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.8<br><br>Above all, there was boredom. Everywhere there was the same routine, from 5:45 first bugle call and reveille followed by raising of the flag at 6:10, through breakfast and assembly, to setting out for work on building bridges and stringing telegraph wires, to roll call in the evening and lights-�out at 11:00 p.m. For Arthur, this routine was broken only occasionally, by some memorable event. He would be present, for example, on May 10, 1869, when Leland Stanford drove in the golden spike joining the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads at Promontory Summit, Utah, as America&#x2019;s Transcontinental Railroad was finally complete. In January 1871 he was given leave to attend the wedding of his father and his new wife, who was seven years the judge&#x2019;s junior, in Washington, D.C., where his father now made his home (this wife, Judge MacArthur&#x2019;s third, was the daughter of a highly successful congressman). But otherwise, those first eight years of army service were ones of brain-�crushing tedium for an army officer with no vices except perhaps the occasional glass of whiskey during a game of whist for minor stakes.<br><br>To relieve the boredom, Arthur MacArthur mostly read. He would have the judge send books on to him at his various posts, in addition to stacks of journals like Harper&#x2019;s Weekly, North American Review, and Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine. We know MacArthur had a fascination for economics and authors like Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and Walter Bagehot, as well as works on ancient and modern history. There was also a growing shelf on China and Japan&#x2014;�not to mention everything and anything he could get his hands on regarding military strategy.9<br><br>But as he sat and read and pondered, or sat in the pew at his father&#x2019;s wedding among the delighted guests and the orange blossoms, he must have wondered when, if ever, he would be married. He was nearing thirty when his new regiment, the Eighteenth Infantry, was transferred to Jackson Barracks outside New Orleans. There he would meet the woman who would transform his life, and serve as a pillar of strength both for Arthur and for his even more famous son.<br><br>Mary Pinckney Hardy was a true Southern belle. If Arthur MacArthur was John Wayne from a John Ford western, &#x201c;Pinky&#x201d; Hardy was Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara from Gone with the Wind.<br><br>Headstrong, vivacious, and darkly beautiful, she was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Norfolk. Her son Douglas, for whom she would become the single most important person in his life, described her heritage this way:<br><br>Mary Pinckney Hardy came from an old Virginia family dating back to Jamestown days.

An invaluable resource for all trainers and therapists, it includes a range of powerful scripts.</p><p>Tad James M.S., Ph.D. is one of the world&#39;s most influential trainers, and a respected authority on hypnosis. He teaches and appears before audiences for over 200 days every year, and is president of The American Board of Hypnotherapy, one of the world&#39;s largest hypnotherapy organisations. Tad is also President of Advanced Neuro-Dynamics, a leading NLP firm, The American Institute of Hypnotherapy, the world&#39;s leading hypnosis institute, and American Pacific University, a Hawaii-based institution offering alternative degrees in Hypnosis, Psychology, and Esoteric Studies.The doorway to success in hypnosis is the Unconscious Mind. Your Unconscious Mind not only holds information that is outside your consciousness, but it also manages sensations and body functions. A moment before reading this sentence, you probably were not aware of the feeling of your feet against the floor, or your back against the chair. You have sensations coming to your body all the time, but you remain unaware of most of them. In addition to managing all these sensations, your Unconscious Mind keeps your heart beating, your blood circulating, your digestion working, and your lymph system operating and makes your eyes blink without your conscious awareness. It is exciting to know that your Unconscious Mind manages all of that with perfect precision. A prime concept that we are going to explore is that your Unconscious Mind can communicate with every cell in the body. Until the mid-1980s, people could plausibly say, "Hypnosis is just in your Mind! It's not real." But recently, due to the pioneering work of Dr Deepak Chopra, scientists have begun to realize the full extent of the Mind/Body connection. Not only does information from the Mind affect the body, but there is now scientific evidence that your mental processes, mental states, and mental behaviours affect all the cells in your body all the time. Information is carried within the body in the form of electrical impulses that pass through nerve cells, or neurons. Between any two neurons, there is a gap, or synapse. In order for impulses to travel along a continuous path of nerve cells, something has to carry the impulses across the gaps. This essential task is performed by neuro-transmitters, which are chemicals that conduct electrical impulses across the synapses between nerve cells. <p> When neuro-transmitters were first discovered, scientists thought they were found only in the brain. Later, it was discovered that neuro-transmitters actually connect all neurons in the body, forming vast networks of 'electrical circuits'. More recently, quantum physics and quantum biology tell us that neuro-transmitters bathe every cell in the human body. This new knowledge is the key to the Mind/Body connection. </p><p> The Unconscious Mind not only manages sensations, movements and body functions, but it also actually sends information that travels to and affects billions of individual cells throughout the body, giving us health or dis-ease according to our Unconscious beliefs. Chopra describes this as your immune system constantly eavesdropping on your internal dialogue. </p><p> From the point of view of hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming, your immune system is also eavesdropping on the pictures that you hold in your head the sounds that you remember or pay attention to the feelings that you have and the concepts that your mind considers. Through the conductivity of the neuro-transmitters that surround all cells, your immune system is constantly affected by the activity of your Unconscious Mind. </p><p> There are many things we are conscious of, but the operation and health of the body is optimally a function of our Unconscious. Hypnosis allows us to begin reaching the Unconscious Mind and utilizing the Mind/Body connection. This is the beginning of our ability to manifest a number of wonderful things.</p></p><h2>And the Rest Is History: The Chronicles of St. Mary&#39;s Book Eight</h2><p><b>The eighth book in the bestselling British madcap time-travelling series, served with a dash of wit that seems to be everyone&#x2019;s cup of tea.</b><br><br>Behind the seemingly innocuous facade of St. Mary&#x2019;s Institute of Historical Research, a different kind of academic work is taking place.

So much of what he preached&#x2014;most broadly about land and water stewardship&#x2014;remains prophetically to the point today.</p><p>John Ross is a former editor of American Heritage and an adventure writer with extensive whitewater experience. His previous books are <i>Enduring Courage: Ace Pilot Eddie Rickenbacker and the Dawn of the Age of Speed </i>and <i>War on the Run: The Epic Story of Robert Rogers and the Conquest of America's First Frontier</i>, which won the Fort Ticonderoga Award for Contributions to American History.Chapter 1<br><br>Into the Cauldron<br><br>In 1838, four-year-old Wes rode next to his father, Joseph Powell, on the last leg of their journey south to Jackson from Chillicothe, their horse-drawn cart rolling easily down the unusually wide dirt road that wound through the rugged Appalachian foothills of southeastern Ohio. They may have felt like pioneers, but that same hard-beaten path had carried multifarious travelers since the last Ice Age, all drawn by the region's salt licks-the deposits of natural saltwater springs-so thick as to permanently frost the banks of local creeks.<br><br>First had come the mastodons and shaggy mammoths of the Pleistocene, later followed by herds of bison-and then the first human beings to leave a mark on the land, the mysterious mound-building peoples of a mere two millennia before. In historic times, the Shawnee had padded silently on moccasined feet, and just three decades earlier, the first European settlers had crossed the Appalachians to settle. Six age-old "salt roads" converged like the spokes of a wagon wheel upon what had only very recently become the town of Jackson.<br><br>The Powells cart pulled up the steep escarpment to the rutted main street of Jackson, which crested the fifty-foot ridgeline, commanding views of a rugged hilly land harrowed by ridges, deep ravines, and creeks. Mean-looking wooden houses did duty for the town'ss main street, every bit as tough as its namesake, Andrew Jackson, Indian killer and hard-handed populist president. Eden it was not, but elements of civilization had reached there, most notably Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist churches. Jackson also boasted a post office, hotel, and six shops, including Mrs. Sylvester's, which sold ginger cakes. The town hall faced French's Tavern, Jackson's most thriving establishment.<br><br>The thirty-four-year-old Methodist preacher had brought his young family here from western New York State at the suggestion of a fellow Welsh minister. They had agreed that too few souls were left to save in the New York panhandle, a region roiled by evangelical Christian revivals. The Reverend Benjamin Childlaw knew of several largely Welsh communities that thrived twenty miles outside Jackson, whose man worked blast furnaces that turned rich local veins of iron ore into pig iron, which the burgeoning railroads were already consuming in great quantities. Childlaw figured that these devout Calvinistic Methodists might profit from some ministering. That was all Joseph had needed to uproot his wife, Mary, two daughters, and Wes, to journey some five hundred miles southwest.<br><br>Joseph likely did not know that his destination lay in a veritable war zone. Only fifty miles separated Jackson from the Ohio River, which separated the free state of Ohio from slaveholding Kentucky. The lands bordering this "magic line"-as Harriet Tubman famously called it-rippled and bucked in disorder as southern bounty hunters pursued slaves escaping northward, often clashing with those who did not recognize human beings as chattel. In Ohio particularly, an outspoken breed of take-no-prisoners abolitionism had arisen, met with equally strident resistance from a merchant class desperate to preserve commerce with the cotton-rich South. And a hundred and twenty miles west of Jackson, in Cincinnati, the harrowing story of a mother's winter passage over the frozen Ohio to freedom, clutching her baby to her breast, would inspire Harriet Beecher Stowe to write the antislavery polemic Uncle Tom's Cabin, which next to the Bible would become the most-read book of the nineteenth century and hasten the nation toward terrible civil war.<br><br>Joseph's immersion in this fraught borderland would force him down an unanticipated path. Unlike the vast majority of evangelical Methodists, most of whom condoned slavery-either owning slaves themselves or trusting in the Peculiar Institution to fade in time-Joseph would find that his faith called upon him to reject human bondage outright. He would become a radical, one among only a handful of white abolitionists making up a fringe movement whose members Ralph Waldo Emerson dismissed as "angry bigots." No one, certainly not the Sage of Concord, liked even the hint of getting their noses rubbed in the moral contradictions upon which the Founders had built the republic. Joseph's newly awakened beliefs would bring violence to his family's very door; his son would feel the repercussions of his father's radicalized passions most keenly. A flare of violence would imprint itself on the boy for life, shaping-more than any other experience over seven decades-how he would bring himself to face this treacherous world.<br><br>Joseph Powell's most symbolic act in America had come four years earlier as he held his newborn eldest surviving male child for the first time. Staring into the infant's blinking eyes, he named him John Wesley; not simply John or Wesley, but the full name of Methodism's great founder. The Welsh immigrant had first felt Methodism's powerful urgings in the Old World, but it would be in the New that they would fully flower. By so naming his son, Joseph had solemnly pledged the infant Wes to carry on the work of the Lord to which he himself had so ardently committed. Joseph would see to it that his son memorize the Gospels and shout out the hymns.<br><br>From an early age, Wes felt his father's expectations weigh heavily upon his small shoulders. His father would leave for a month at a time to preach across the wilderness: Armed with a Bible, a volume of John Wesley's sermons, and a hymnbook without musical notations, Joseph would saddle up the family horse and ride forth on a twelve-stop circuit that would take him away for an eternity-or so it must have seemed to a family that ultimately swelled to eight children. Young Wes increasingly took on the duties of helping his siblings read their Bible lessons and sing their hymns. In these long absences his mother, Mary, tempered the often rough edges of zeal that Joseph left behind, providing emotional support for her often-overburdened eldest son.<br><br>Wes had to grow up fast in a nation spreading ever faster before his feet and those of hundreds of thousands of other new Americans. No one had anticipated the speed with which the newly arrived Europeans, along with their enslaved Africans and West Indians, would settle the continent. Thomas Jefferson thought it might take a thousand years to reach the far Pacific, when in fact it took only a long lifetime. The frontier of 1800, running along the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, would jump beyond the Ohio Valley in just nine years, then surge across the length of the Mississippi by 1850. In 1890, the U.S. Census would declare the frontier gone.<br><br>In the first few decades of the nineteenth century, the flood of immigrants poured into the vast "trans-Appalachian" West-defined as the area west of the Appalachians, but east of the Mississippi-which contained more square miles than Great Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium combined. They came from England, Germany, Switzerland, Scotland, Ireland, Belgium, France, Wales, the West Indies, and West Africa, borne by flatboat up the Ohio, on wagon or foot along ancient Indian trails, or later-like the Powells-upon the Erie Canal. Many of these newcomers could not speak English, and many were semiliterate at best; few had any idea what America-scarcely more than a name on the wind-offered aside from raw opportunity. This overwhelming tide brought about one of the most explosive population increases in history.<br><br>The center of American gravity-its politics, its institutional loyalties-was shifting inexorably west and south. With the federal government weak, as Andrew Jackson had willed it, at least by European standards, and no state religion to clarify doctrines of morality and conduct, the trans-Appalachian West lay in a ferment of new ideas and institutions. Evangelical Protestantism took hold tenaciously: Few other periods of sectarian growth in the history of Christianity rival its wildfire spread across America's heartland. Revivalist, evangelical Protestantism overshadowed the Anglican and Congregational traditions of the East Coast within a generation of the opening of the Erie Canal. New denominational energies, such as those of the Methodists, Baptists, and even entirely new churches-the Shakers, Disciples of Christ, Millerites-flourished, but none rose and spread so quickly as Methodism, which had outpaced all other American denominations by 1850.<br><br>Joseph lent his considerable energies to an inspired Methodist strategy to bring the Word to this huge moving frontier. He and some four thousand other circuit-riding preachers set out to reach remote settlements on horseback and foot. Often not even ordained, yet licensed to preach, many circuit riders came from among the ranks of artisans and shopkeepers who could support themselves and their families without depending on meager central church stipends. When not riding the appalling roads, Joseph worked long hours in the front room of their small house on Jackson's Main Street, stitching coats, shirts, and jackets late into the night by the flicker of a single candle. Better to wear out than to rust out, as the Founder liked to say.<br><br>In a land yet to see a national newspaper or electric telegraph, in which information traveled at the speed of a man on horseback and the post office was viewed with suspicion as an arm of intrusive government, the circuit riders stepped in as newsbearers and moral purveyors, arbiters of good manners and proper dress, the critical dispensers of knowledge and propriety to the young republic. For a generation or more, the cultural cohesion of trans-Appalachia was largely shaped and energized by the dedicated flock of exhausted, saddle-sore men pushing their horses from settlement to settlement. The peculiarly American figure of the itinerant preacher evoked the popular midwesterners' response to bad weather: "There's nothing out today but crows and Methodist preachers." The 1784 Book of Discipline, which laid down the principles and doctrine of the Church, contained words rewritten for an America suddenly embracing a continental vision: "To reform the continent, and to spread scriptural holiness over these lands." Methodism formed the bedrock of the American South's and Midwest's blend of apolitical anti-elitism and social conservatism.<br><br>The circuit rider depended on families to shelter and feed him. In return, he passed on news of his earlier stops-of who had died and who had been born, the by no means infrequent roster of appalling accidents or outbreaks of disease that haunted the frontier-sold the books he carried with him, both religious and secular, and handed out dated newspapers. The task routinely included passing on information not just about the next town, but about the rather ill-defined world at large, and how to live better in their own. Ordained or not, he might perform a marriage, funeral, or baptism. At midday, wherever he was, he would set up at a crossroads, perhaps, in front of a homestead, or quite frequently, in a mere field or barn-and set to preaching. Without notes, he would sermonize in homespun prose, Bible in hand, outlining how living John Wesley's "methodical" life meant forgoing cursing, drinking spirits, committing adultery, fornicating, and dressing provocatively or ostentatiously. "Cleanliness is next to godliness," he might tell them, citing one of Wesley's innumerable and often memorable axioms. Methodist preachers were advised themselves to "Beware of clownishness, [either in speech or dress. Wear no slouched hat.] Be courteous to all." He would lead them in a few hymns, perhaps "Amazing Grace" or "Come, Sinner, to the Gospel Feast."<br><br>The riders offered the men, women, and children of this New World the intoxicating chance to wipe away their sins right there and then on that patch of meadow, dusty road, or porch front-but only if they repented and took Jesus Christ as their personal savior. For a young republic of immigrants on the move, Joseph and his circuit-riding brethren brought nourishment that no bread or riches could provide, the chance to unload sins and embrace the opportunities of living a God-fearing, productive life in a land full of uncertainties. For Wes, the message rang clear that through self-discipline and constant industry, human beings could overcome evil and the challenges of a new land.</p><h2>D.

At least one consequence of this is that it is often disaffiliated from the church's theological heritage. Purves examines Christian writers from the past who represent the classical tradition in pastoral theology--classical in the sense that they and their texts have shaped the minds and practices of pastors in enduring ways. He reflects on texts from Gregory Nazianzus, John Chrysostom, Gregory the Great, Martin Bucer, and Richard Baxter. He includes a brief biography of each author, introduces the major themes in the writer's theology, and discusses the issues arising for pastoral work.</p></p><p><b>Andrew Purves</b> is Professor of Reformed Theology at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p><h2>On the Shores of the Great Sea (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Book I in The Story of the World series, by M. B. Synge, &#34;On the Shores of the Great Sea&#34; focuses on the civilizations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea from the time of Abraham to the birth of Christ. Brief histories of the Ancient Israelites, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Scythians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans are given, concluding with the conquest of the entire Mediterranean area by Rome. Important myths and legends that preceded recorded history are also related. Suitable for children ages 9 and up to read to themselves and for children as young as 6 as a read-aloud. The Story of the World series, by M. B. Synge, comprises a set of five volumes, written at a middle school reading level, that cover all major events in the history of Western Civilization, from earliest recorded history to the close of the nineteenth century. With fifty or so short chapters in each volume, the series links the great eras in time and place together by a chain of stories of individuals who played principal parts in the events related. While statesmen and military commanders figure heavily in the narrative, stories of explorers, scientists, artists, authors, and religious figures are also presented. The author writes in an engaging fashion, using dialog frequently to bring scenes to life. She juxtaposes events happening at the same time in different parts of the world in a style reminiscent of the books of Genevieve Foster.

Stocky, hard, balding&#x2014;he looked like he had just walked out of Central Casting after successfully landing the role of &#x201c;bulldog&#x2013;jawed older detective.&#x201d; He owned Milano Investigations, and under his supervision, the firm ran like clockwork. No emergency rattled Dominic. He never raised his voice. Nothing knocked him off his stride. Before moving to the Pacific Northwest, he&#x2019;d retired from the Miami Police Department with over a thousand homicide cases under his belt. He&#x2019;d been there and done that, so nothing surprised him.</p><p>That was why watching his furry eyebrows creep up on his forehead was so satisfying.</p><p>Dominic plucked the top photograph from the stack on his desk. On it, Spenser &#x201c;Spense&#x201d; Bailey jogged down the street. The next shot showed Spense bending over. The next one caught him in a classic baseball&#x2013;pitch pose, right leg raised, leaning back, a tennis ball in his fingers. Which would be fine and dandy, except that according to his doctor, Spense suffered from a herniated disk in his spine. He was restocking a warehouse when a walk&#x2013;behind forklift got away from him, and the accident caused him constant, excruciating pain. He could frequently be seen limping around the neighborhood with a cane or a walker. He needed help to get into a car, and he couldn&#x2019;t drive because the injured disk pinched the nerve in his right leg.</p><p>Dominic glanced at Audrey. &#x201c;These are great. We&#x2019;ve been following this guy for weeks, and nothing. How did you get these?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A very short tennis skirt. He hobbles past a tennis court every Tuesday and Thursday on the way to his physical&#x2013;therapy sessions.&#x201d; The hardest part was hitting the ball so it would fly over the tall fence. A loud gasp and a run with an extra bounce in her step, and she had him. &#x201c;Keep looking. It gets better.&#x201d;</p><p>Dominic flipped through the stack. The next photo showed Spense with a goofy grin on his face carrying two cups of coffee, maneuvering between tables at Starbucks with the grace of a deer.</p><p>&#x201c;You bought him coffee?&#x201d; Dominic&#x2019;s eyebrows crawled a little higher.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not. He bought me coffee. And a fruit salad.&#x201d; Audrey grinned.</p><p>&#x201c;You really enjoy doing this, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Dominic reflected.</p><p>She nodded. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a liar and a cheat, who&#x2019;s been out of work for months on the company&#x2019;s dime.&#x201d; And he thought he was so smart. He was practically begging to be cut down to size, and she had just the right pruning shears. Chop&#x2013;chop.</p><p>Dominic moved the coffee picture aside and stopped. &#x201c;Is this what I think this is?&#x201d;</p><p>The next image showed Spense grasping a man in a warm&#x2013;up suit from behind and tossing him backward over his head onto a mat.</p><p>&#x201c;That would be Spense demonstrating a German suplex for me.&#x201d; Audrey gave him a bright smile. &#x201c;Apparently he&#x2019;s an amateur MMA fighter. He goes to do his physical therapy on the first floor, and, after the session is over, he walks up the stairs to spar.&#x201d;</p><p>Dominic put his hands together and sighed.</p><p>Something was wrong. She leaned back. &#x201c;Suddenly you don&#x2019;t seem happy.&#x201d;</p><p>Dominic grimaced. &#x201c;I look at you, and I&#x2019;m confused. People who do the best in our line of work are unremarkable. They look just like anyone else, and they&#x2019;re easily forgettable, so suspects don&#x2019;t pay attention to them. They have some law&#x2013;enforcement experience, usually at least some college. You&#x2019;re too pretty, your hair is too red, your eyes are too big, you laugh too loud, and, according to your transcripts, you barely graduated from high school.&#x201d;</p><p>Warning sirens wailed in her head. Dominic required proof of high&#x2013;school graduation before employment, so she brought him both her diploma and her senior&#x2013;year transcript. For some reason, he had bothered to pull her file and review the contents. Her driver&#x2019;s license was first&#x2013;rate because it was real. Her birth certificate and her high&#x2013;school record would pass a cursory inspection, but if he dug any deeper, he&#x2019;d find smoke. And if he took her fingerprints, he would find criminal records in two states.</p><p>Audrey kept the smile firmly in place. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help having big eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>Dominic sighed again. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the deal: I hire freelancers to save money. My full&#x2013;time guys are experienced and educated, which means I have to pay them a decent wage for their time. Unless there is serious money involved, I can&#x2019;t afford for them to sit on a tough suspect for months, waiting for him to slip up. They get four weeks to crack a case. After that, I have to outsource this kind of stuff to freelancers like you because I can pay you per job. An average freelancer might close one case every couple of months. It&#x2019;s a good part&#x2013;time gig for most people.&#x201d;</p><p>He was telling her things she already knew. Nothing to do but nod.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been freelancing for me for five months. You closed fourteen cases. That&#x2019;s a case every two weeks. You made twenty grand.&#x201d; Dominic fixed her with his unblinking stare. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t afford to keep you on as a freelancer.&#x201d;</p><p>What? &#x201c;I made you money!&#x201d;</p><p>He held up his hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too expensive, Audrey. The only way this professional relationship is going to survive is if you come to work for me full&#x2013;time.&#x201d;</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll start you off at thirty grand a year with benefits. Here&#x2019;s the paperwork.&#x201d; Dominic handed her a manila envelope. &#x201c;If you decide to take me up on it, I&#x2019;ll see you Monday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do that.&#x201d;</p><p>Audrey swiped the file. Her grifter instincts said, &#x201c;Play it cool,&#x201d; but then, she didn&#x2019;t have to con people anymore. Not those who hired her, anyway. &#x201c;Thank you. Thank you so much. This means the world to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everybody needs a chance, Audrey. You earned yours. We&#x2019;d be glad to have you.&#x201d; Dominic extended his hand over the table. She shook it and left the office.</p><p>A real job. With benefits. Holy crap.</p><p>She took the stairs, jogging down the steps to burn off some excitement. A real job being one of the good guys. How about that?</p><p>If her parents ever found out, they would flip.</p><p>Audrey drove down Rough Ocean Road away from Olympia. Her blue Honda powered on through the gray drizzle that steadily soaked the west side of Cascades. A thick blanket of dense clouds smothered the sky, turning the early evening gloomy and dark. Trees flanked the road: majestic Douglas firs with long emerald needles; black cottonwoods, tall and lean, catching the rain with large branches; red alders with silver&#x2013;gray bark that almost glowed in the dusk.</p><p>A mile and a half ahead, a lonely subdivision of identical houses waited, cradled in the fold of the hill; meanwhile, the road was empty. Nothing but the trees.</p><p>Audrey glanced at the clock. Thirty&#x2013;two minutes so far, not counting the time it took her to stop at a convenience store to get some teriyaki jerky for Ling and the time she spent driving around to different pharmacies. Getting to work would mean an actual commute.</p><p>She loved the job with Milano&#x2019;s investigative agency. She loved every moment of it, from quietly hiding in a car to watch a suspect to running a con on the conmen. They thought they were slick. They didn&#x2019;t know what slick was.</p><p>To be fair, most of the suspects she ran across were conmen of opportunity. They got hurt on the job and liked the disability, or they got tangled in an affair and were too afraid or too arrogant to tell their spouses. They didn&#x2019;t see what they were doing as a con. They viewed it as a little white lie, the easiest path out of a tough situation. Most of them went about their deceptions in amateur ways. Audrey had been running cons since she could talk. It wasn&#x2019;t a fair fight, but then, in the world of grifters, &#x201c;fair&#x201d; had no meaning.</p><p>Ahead, the road forked. The main street rolled right, up the hill, toward the subdivision, while the smaller road branched left, ducking under the canopy of trees. Audrey checked the rearview mirror. The ribbon of pavement behind her stretched into the distance, deserted. The coast was clear.</p><p>She smoothly made the turn onto the smaller road and braced herself. Panic punched her in the stomach, right in the solar plexus. Audrey gasped. The world swirled in a dizzying rush, and she let go of the wheel for a second to keep from wrenching the vehicle off the pavement. Pain followed, sharp, prickling every inch of her skin with red&#x2013;hot needles, and although Audrey had expected it, the ache still caught her by surprise. Pressure squeezed her, then, just like that, all discomfort vanished. She had passed through the boundary.</p><p>A warm feeling spread through Audrey, flowing from her chest all the way to her fingertips. She smiled and snapped her fingers. With a warm tingle, tendrils of green glow swirled around her hand. Magic. Also known as flash. She let it die and kept driving.</p><p>Back on the main road, in the city of Olympia, in the State of Washington, magic didn&#x2019;t exist. People who lived there tried to pretend that it did. They flirted with the idea of psychics and street magicians, but they had never encountered the real thing. Most of them wouldn&#x2019;t even see the side road she took. For them it simply wasn&#x2019;t there&#x2014;the woods continued uninterrupted. Every time Audrey crossed into their world, the boundary stripped her magic from her in a rush of pain. That&#x2019;s why people like her called that place the Broken&#x2014;when you passed into it, you gave up a part of yourself, and it left you feeling incomplete. Broken like a clock with a missing gear.</p><p>Far ahead, past mountains and miles of rough terrain, another world waited, a mirror to the Broken, full of magic but light on technology. Well, not exactly true, Audrey reflected. The Weird had plenty of complex technology, but it had evolved in a different direction. Most of it functioned with the aid of magic. In the Weird, the power of your magic and the color of your flash determined the course of your life. The brighter you flashed, the better. If you flashed white, you could rub elbows with bluebloods, the Weird&#x2019;s aristocratic families.</p><p>The Weird, like the Broken, was a place of rules and laws. That&#x2019;s why Audrey preferred to live here, in the no&#x2013;man&#x2019;s land between the two dimensions. The locals called it the Edge, and they were right. It was on the edge of both worlds, a place without countries or cops, where the castoffs like her washed ashore. Connecting the two dimensions like a secret overpass, the Edge took everyone. Swindlers, thieves, crazed separatists, clannish families, all were welcome, all were dirt&#x2013;poor, and all kept to themselves. The Edgers gave no quarter and expected no sympathy.</p><p>The road turned to dirt. The trees had changed, too. Ancient spruces spread broad branches from massive buttressed trunks, their limbs dripping with long emerald green beards of tangled moss. Towering narrow hemlocks thrust into the sky, their roots cushioned in ferns. Blue haze clung to narrow spaces between the trunks, hiding otherworldly things with glowing eyes who prowled in search of prey.</p><p>As Audrey drove through, bright yellow blossoms of Edger primrose sensed the vibration of the car and snapped open with faint puffs of luminescent pollen. By day the flowers stayed closed and harmless. At night, it was a different story. Take a couple of puffs in your face, and pretty soon you&#x2019;d forget where you were or why you were here. A couple of weeks ago, Rook, one of the local Edger idiots, got drunk and fell asleep near a patch of them. They found him two days later, sitting up on a tree stump butt naked and covered in ants. This was an old forest, nourished by magic. It didn&#x2019;t suffer fools, gladly or otherwise.</p><p>She steered her Honda up the narrow road, past her driveway, forcing it to climb higher and higher up the mountain. A shadow loomed ahead, blocking the way. She flicked on her brights. An old pine had fallen across the road. She&#x2019;d have to hoof it to Gnome&#x2019;s house. The road was muddy with recent rain, and she had new shoes on. Oh well. Shoes could be cleaned.</p><p>Audrey parked, pulled the emergency brake as high as it would go, swiped the plastic bags off the seat, and climbed out. Mud squished under the soles of her shoes. She climbed over the tree and trudged up the narrow road, following it all the way up to the top of the mountain. By the time she made it to the clearing, the sky had grown dim. Gnome&#x2019;s house, a large two&#x2013;story jumble of weird rooms sticking out at random angles, was all but lost in the gloom.</p><p>&#x201c;Gnome!&#x201d;</p><p>No answer.</p><p>&#x201c;Gnooome!&#x201d;</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He was inside. He had to be&#x2014;his old beat&#x2013;up Chevy sat on the left side of the house, and Gnome rarely left the top of the mountain anyway. Audrey walked up to the door and tried the handle. Locked. She put her hand to the keyhole and pushed. The magic slid from her fingers in translucent currents of pale green and wove together, sliding into the keyhole. That old ornery knucklehead would probably kill her for this. The lock clicked. Audrey eased the door open smoothly, making sure it didn&#x2019;t creak, more out of habit than real need.</p><p>Flash was a pure expression of one&#x2019;s magic. But most people born with it had a talent or two hidden up their sleeve. Some Edgers were cursers, some foretold the future. She opened doors.</p><p>Audrey passed through the narrow hallway into the main room, sectioned off by tall shelves filled with Gnome&#x2019;s knickknacks and merchandise. Being a local fence, he had enough inventory to put Costco to shame. He also functioned as an emergency general store. If Edgers needed deodorant or soap in a hurry and didn&#x2019;t want to drive all the way across the boundary, they stopped at Gnome&#x2019;s. And ended up paying ten bucks for a tube of toothpaste.</p><p>A fit of wet, hoarse coughing came from deeper within the house. Audrey slipped between the shelves, like a silent shadow, and finally stepped out into the clear space in the middle of the room.</p><p>Gnome, a huge bear of a man, sat slumped over in his stuffed chair, an open book on a desk in front of him and a shotgun by his chair. Flushed skin, tangled hair, feverish eyes, all hunkered down in a blanket. He looked like a mess.</p><p>&#x201c;There you are.&#x201d;</p><p>He peered at her with watering, bloodshot eyes. &#x201c;What the hell are you&#x2014;&#x201d; Another fit of coughing shook his large frame.</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds awful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you&#x2014;&#x201d; Gnome sneezed.</p><p>&#x201c;I brought you goodies.&#x201d; She pulled a box of decongestant pills out of the bag and put it on the desk. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ve got canned chicken soup, Theraflu, and here are some cough drops, and here is a box of Puffs tissues with lotion, so you don&#x2019;t scrub all of the skin off that big beak of yours.&#x201d;</p><p>He stared at her, speechless. Now that was something. If she had a camera, she should take a picture.</p><p>&#x201c;And this here, this is good stuff.&#x201d; Audrey tapped the plastic cup of Magic Vaporizer. &#x201c;I had to hunt it down&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t make it as much anymore, so I could only get a generic version. Look, you boil some water and put these drops in here and inhale&#x2014;clears your nose right up. I&#x2019;ll fix you one, then you can yell at me.&#x201d;</p><p>Five minutes later, she presented him with a steaming vaporizer and made him breathe it in. One, two, three . . .</p><p>Gnome sucked in his first breath. &#x201c;Christ.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Told you.&#x201d; Audrey set a hot bowl of chicken soup on his desk. &#x201c;Wo...</p></p><h2>Finding Your Best Places: Using Astrocartography to Navigate Your Life (Best Places Astrocartography)</h2><p>Finding Your Best Places: Using Astrocartography to Navigate Your Life is Dan Furst's long-awaited first ebook on today&#x2019;s hottest astrology topic, the exciting new art and science of Astrocartography. This word simply means that we take the same information an astrologer uses to create birth charts and horoscopes &#x2013; that is, a person&#x2019;s date, time and place of birth &#x2013; and we use them to create world maps that are personal and unique, and useful in guiding us to our best destinations for jobs and money, health, family, love relationships, creative and spiritual paths, community, travel destinations, whatever matters most to us. Each astrocartography map has sets of colored lines that have planet symbols in triangles pointing up to the top of the map, or the bottom, or east or west. So the lines show us not only which planet energies are at work in each place, but in which direction they go: to the soul (up), the body (down), our individual goals (east) or relationships (west). The lines also form connections and crossings -- just as the planets in our birth charts have meaningful, powerful angles of relationship -- so we can easily tell which places in the world are energetically charged for us, whether for success or struggle, and which are neutral "rest areas." Joint readings for couples, families and business teams are especially useful for identifying places that are most beneficial for living and working, and for finding important relationships. Astrocartographers often insist, in fact, on reading for both members of a committed couple, in order to highlight places that are good for them both, and avoid locations that are great for one partner, but challenging, at the very least, for the other. Another crucial point is that astrocartography is not just for helping people find their best places to live and work, though this was the main question when Jim Lewis created his new system 40 years ago. Now second-generation astrocartographers often tell new clients: You Don't Have to Move! People who are quite happy where they are can still use their astrocartography lines to find the places that best favor them for finding employers, clients, colleagues, healers, publishers, investors and love partners. Looking at our astrocartography maps as well as our birth charts can now tell us not only the conditions of timing that astrology has always explored, but also, for the first time, the conditions of SPACE as well. While astrologers have long used different ways of connecting zodiac signs with countries and cities, so that, for example, the very theatrical land of Italy may be called a &#x201c;Leo country,&#x201d; it is only now that we can see, in precise detail, exactly which places on Earth really favor us, personally and individually, or may have important relationships for us. There are profound spiritual implications to these locational matters as well, and we may find in time that our tendencies, interests, gifts and challenges may all be reflected in the astro-geography of the sky, and this is why we feel attracted to the spiritual traditions and practices of specific places, and why some places just mysteriously seem to keep calling us. And what may be most important to many of us, is that astrocartography may show us what places are most important for the fulfilling of our Sacred Contracts, and the challenges and opportunities they offer for the pursuit of our spiritual goals, and our evolution toward enlightenment and freedom. In the end, what matters is that astrocartography gets more popular every year. It's not just because we want to find our best places now in very fluid and unpredictable times, or because we're more mobile and globally connected that ever before in wider, more versatile networks of business, social contacts and bonds of love and spirit. Astrocartography is hot now because it WORKS. It's helped thousands of people find their purpose, stoke their passion, ignite their courage and hit their goals.</p><p>Have you ever asked yourself if life could be a lot easier, richer and better in some otherplace? Or wondered how some people find backers, colleagues, teachers, healers and otherimportant relationships right in the places where they need them to be?&nbsp;<br><br>How come someplaces fascinate us, and we love traveling to them? Are there any places that mysteriouslyseem to be calling you?<br> <br>Astrocartography can solve a lot of the mystery. It's the most exciting new field in astrologybecause it works, in solid, practical terms. Since it was pioneered in the 1970's, it's helpedthousands of people, their families and teams find their best places for jobs and money,love and family, health and education, creativity and community, all the things that mattermost to us.<br> <br>Even if you're like most people, and you're happy where you are, Astrocartography can stillhelp you find where important relationships may be waiting for you: with your mentor, astrategic investor or publisher. Even your love partner, right there under your Venus line.<br> In this time of profound change, we're in creative motion as we've never been before. If youcan envision your goals, Astrocartography can draw your map.<br> <br>"Dan Furst is one of the best astrology writers out there."<br>Rob Brezsny, Free Will Astrology<br> <br>Comments on Dan Furst's Astrocartography Work:<br> <br>"I love your astrological work, Dan, and often quote you while doing talks on the 2012transits in Ireland." &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret Gray, Dublin, Ireland<br> <br>"Dan's interpretation of the lines the Universe has drawn for me, through the place I havechosen to live now, was confirming and precise.

He also has two middle grade novels,&nbsp;<i>Zack Delacruz: Me and My Big Mouth</i>&nbsp;(Sterling, 2015) and&nbsp;<i>Zack Delacruz: Just My Luck</i>&nbsp;(Sterling, October 2016).</p><p>Jeff grew up in Austin, where he learned to love writing through journaling, a bit of positive reinforcement, and writing stories and dramas to entertain his friends on the phone. He wanted to become a teacher early on, but his parents tried to convince him otherwise. "They wanted me to make more money." During an internship visit to a local elementary classroom, he made up his mind. "When I saw those curious eyes, kids raising their hands, asking questions, I lost all track of time and from that moment on, I was a teacher. I want to create environments that feel safe for learners at the elementary, middle, and university levels and during professional development for teachers. Working together we figure out things, surprise each other, find our strengths, and experience the joy it is to be a learner and teacher. We are students and teachers to each other."</p><p>Jeff specializes in writing, revision, and grammar. "I love the ability to spark curiosity and creativity and to support students in finding their voices. That's pure joy." When it comes to his own professional development, he wants to explore things that have meaning to him in the classroom. "I want to find out things I didn't know, be affirmed or reminded of what I do know, and be energized by thinking and action, reflection and application. Since that's what I want, that's what I give teachers. Something they can take, shape, and make their own. Something they can use right now."</p><p>Jeff's first book&nbsp;<i>Mechanically Inclined</i>, came to life from what he didn't know and what he needed to know. "I read, tried things out, played in my head and in my classroom, and read some more, permutating and refining. I thought about what worked and what didn't, as well as what sound pedagogical principles are used in other disciplines."</p><p>His other books also came from his work in his own classrooms and those across the United States. The invitational process&nbsp;<i>Everyday Editing</i>&nbsp;is built around was first shared in workshops until teachers wanted another book on grammar.&nbsp;<i>10 Things&nbsp;</i>was Jeff's chance to share what his experience had taught him are the essential things every writer needs to know and be able to do. In his first collaboration, Jeff and Debbie came together to tackle a sentence combining and its larger effects on revision and writing.</p><p>In his free time, Jeff walks his dogs Carl and Paisley or sits on the deck with his partner Terry. When he's not doing that he reads middle grade novels and his new addiction is nonfiction.</p>"Informed, informative, and thoroughly user friendly." - <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br><br>"Anderson has once again left his mark on us through this indispensable book." - <i>Teachers College Record</i></p><h2>100 Questions (and Answers) About Research Methods (SAGE 100 Questions and Answers)</h2><p><p>How do I create a good research hypothesis?

The old, unquestioned confidence with which individuals can be classified (as embodied, for instance, in previous U.S. census categories) has been eroded. In its place are shifting paradigms and new norms for racial identity. Eva Marie Garroutte examines the changing processes of racial identification and their implications by looking specifically at the case of American Indians.</p><p>"In discussing a wide array of legal, biological, and sociocultural definitions, Eva Garroutte documents how these have frequently been manipulated by the federal government, by tribal officials, and by Indian and non-Indian individuals to gain political, social, or economic advantage.

However, social justice work has all too often been conceptualized as a macro intervention, separate and distinct from clinical practice. </p> <p>This practical text is designed to help social workers intervene around the impact of socio-political factors with their clients and integrate social justice into their clinical work. Based on past radical traditions, it introduces and applies a liberation health framework which merges clinical and macro work into a singular, unified way of working with individuals, families, and communities. Opening with a chapter on the theory and historical roots of liberation social work practice, each subsequent chapter goes on to look at a particular population group or individual case study, including:</p> <ul> <p> </p><li>LGBT communities</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Mental health illness</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Violence</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Addiction</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Working with ethnic minorities</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Health</li> <p></p></ul> <p>Written by a team of experienced lecturers and practitioners, <i>Social Justice in Clinical Practice</i> provides a clear, focussed, practice-oriented model of clinical social work for both social work practitioners and students. </p></p><p><p><strong>Dawn Belkin Martinez</strong> is Lecturer in Clinical Practice at the Boston University School of Social Work, USA and formerly an instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

With unparalleled intensity, Euripides--whom Aristotle called the most tragic of poets--describes the horrific brutality that both women and children undergo during war. Yet, in the war's aftermath, this brutality is challenged and a new battleground is revealed where the women of Troy evince an overwhelming greatness of spirit.<br>We weep for the aged Hecuba in her name play and in <em>Trojan Women</em>, while at the same time we admire her resilience amid unrelieved suffering. Andromache, the slave-concubine of her husband's killer, endures her existence in the victor's country with a stoic nobility. Of their time yet timeless, these plays insist on the victory of the female spirit amid the horrors visited on them by the gods and men during war.<br><strong></strong> About the Series: For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

These events gave renewed urgency to the fraught topic of gender in the Middle East. The role of women in public life, the meaning of manhood, and the future of gender inequalities are hotly debated by religious figures, government officials, activists, scholars, and ordinary citizens throughout Egypt. <i>Live and Die Like a Man</i> presents a unique twist on traditional understandings of gender and gender roles, shifting the attention to men and exploring how they are collectively "produced" as gendered subjects. It traces how masculinity is continuously maintained and reaffirmed by both men and women under changing socio-economic and political conditions. Over a period of nearly twenty years, Farha Ghannam lived and conducted research in al-Zawiya, a low-income neighborhood not far from Tahrir Square in northern Cairo. Detailing her daily encounters and ongoing interviews, she develops life stories that reveal the everyday practices and struggles of the neighborhood over the years. We meet Hiba and her husband as they celebrate the birth of their first son and begin to teach him how to become a man; Samer, a forty-year-old man trying to find a suitable wife; Abu Hosni, who struggled with different illnesses; and other local men and women who share their reactions to the uprising and the changing situation in Egypt. Against this backdrop of individual experiences, Ghannam develops the concept of masculine trajectories to account for the various paths men can take to embody social norms. In showing how men work to realize a "male ideal," she counters the prevalent dehumanizing stereotypes of Middle Eastern men all too frequently reproduced in media reports, and opens new spaces for rethinking patriarchal structures and their constraining effects on both men and women.</p><p>Farha Ghannam is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Swarthmore College and author of <i>Remaking the Modern: Space, Relocation, and the Politics of Identity in a Global Cairo</i> (2002). Listen to Farha Ghannam's presentations on "The Life and Death of an Egyptian Man" and "Reflections on Masculinity and Violence in the Egyptian Revolution.""Despite the profusion of works on gender in the Middle East, few studies are devoted to masculinity. This pathbreaking volume is the first to examine Egyptian manhood through an ethnographic lens, following the stories of 'boys-to-men' on the brink of a revolution. A must-read for those interested in Middle East gender studies, anthropology, and contemporary Egypt." (Marcia C. Inhorn <i>Yale University, author of <i>The New Arab Man: Emergent Masculinities, Technologies, and Islam in the Middle East</i></i>)<br><br>"In <i>Live and Die Like a Man: Gender Dynamics in Urban Egypt</i>, anthropologist Farha Ghannam offers a compelling longitudinal study of masculinity in a lower- and middle-income neighborhood in Cairo known as al-Zawiya . . . Ghannam does a wonderful job showing the nuances of masculinity, as well as the complexities and contingencies of the masculine trajectory over time. Well written and accessible, <i>Live and Die Like a Man</i> would be an excellent texts for undergraduate classes, particularly those that aim to dispel stereotypes characterizing Middle Eastern men as macho and violent. This ethnography makes a welcome addition to a growing body of masculinity studies in the contemporary Middle East." (Rachel Newcomb)<br><br>"With its focus on masculinity, Farha Ghannam's thoughtful ethnography, <i>Live and Die Like a Man</i>, makes important interventions into the anthropological scholarship on gender, childhood, and family in the Middle East . . . Her ethnographic sensibility perfectly grasps the dynamic and complex intertwining of male and female ways of being and self-presentation and how that interrelationship forms men's lives." (Nafissa Naguib <i><i>International Journal of Middle East Studies</i></i>)<br><br>"With <i>Live and Die Like a Man</i>, Farha Ghannam is far ahead of the academic curve, setting an imposing standard for future scholarship on the Arab Spring and gender across the Middle East and North Africa. This engrossing book breaks ground by using the study of men's experiences as a method for understanding contemporary societies." (Mark LeVine, University of California <i>Irvine</i>)<br><br>"In this groundbreaking working, anthropologist Farha Ghannam utilizes 20 years of field research in the working class neighborhood of Zawiya al-Hamra to deconstruct the notion of masculinity . . . [T]his work is a huge step forward in the field of Middle East Studies. Little work has been done on masculinity in general, and even less on what it means for the ordinary man." (Mona L. Russell <i><i>Middle East Journal</i></i>)<br><br>"Farha Ghannam skillfully weaves the life stories of Egyptian men with an important accounting of the precarious balance between genders. This is a masterful treatise on masculinity in the Middle East and a timely contribution to understanding the Arab Spring and the socio-political changes facing the region. A book not to be missed." (Sherine Hafez, University of California <i>Riverside</i>)<br><br>"Written in lucid prose and rife with Egyptian Arabic words and phrases that are translated and explained not in endnotes but in body paragraphs, Ghannam draws chiefly on participant observations rather than interviews . . . The result is a rich ethnography that shows rather than merely tells, and makes productive use of the author's long-standing involvement with the community in al-Z�wiya al-Hamra. Overall, this is a captivating study of working-class masculinities in Egypt and makes a significant contribution to the anthropology of the region as well as to masculinity and gender studies." (Kristin V. Monroe)<br><br>"In a book that lives up to its name, anthropologist Ghannam explores what in means to be a man in the working-class neighborhood of Zawiya al-Hamra . . . Her thick descriptions, amassed over 20 years of research, will make readers laugh, cry, and gasp at the lives of these individuals . . . By examining the construct of manhood, Ghannam is charting new territory in Middle Eastern studies. Summing Up: Highly recommended." (M. L. Russell <i><i>CHOICE</i></i>)<br><br>"Informed by nineteen years of field research in the same Cairo neighborhood, anthropologist Farha Ghannam's <i>Live and Die Like a Man</i> offers readers an incredibly well-rounded and dynamic portrait of the making (and remaking) of Egyptian working-class men that is at once intimate in its approach and capacious in its analytic reach . . . [The] explicitness of her critique in <i>Live and Die Like a Man</i> highlights the maturation of Ghannam's own scholarly voice . . . Its careful use of 'stories' to illustrate central theoretical claims makes it highly accessible for students, and its link to the 2011 uprising and (some of) its aftermath offers a way of understanding mass mobilization that is largely absent from most analysis and deeply convincing. Ghannam's insights, carefully wrought through the particular, have broad analytic reach and theoretical significance. Equally valuable for scholars and for teachers, <i>Live and Die Like a Man</i> is essential reading."

I call this Accelerated Aging Syndrome, and it is fast becoming an epidemic in this country. Quite simply, accelerated aging is a faster-than-normal deterioration in the functioning of your body and mind. In my practice, I&#x2019;ve seen it begin with a subtle shift in body shape&#x2013;an expanding waistline or shrinking muscles&#x2013;caused by indulgent eating, lack of exercise, and yo-yo dieting. Your energy decreases while your cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure levels climb. You&#x2019;re tired and achy all the time. Your libido dwindles, your muscles sag, and your skin looks dull. You just don&#x2019;t feel like you can keep up with your job, your kids, and your routine the way you used to. Perhaps most upsetting are symptoms of memory loss, which only add to your level of discouragement and distress. You realize that you <i>feel</i> old&#x2013;even if you&#x2019;re not! <br><br>So why is this happening to so many of us these days? Unfortunately, changes in the American diet and lifestyle have conspired to make us age more rapidly. Before we can begin the process of becoming ten years younger, we need to understand these aging enemies&#x2013;what I call aging accelerators&#x2013;and how they impact our daily lives. <br><br><b>Aging Accelerator #1: Oxidative Stress <br></b>Catherine, a 36-year-old woman living in Olympia, Washington, seemed to be sick all the time. If she wasn&#x2019;t fighting upper respiratory infections, she was in my office complaining of sinus headaches or intestinal cramping. She couldn&#x2019;t think clearly; she seemed depressed; she ached all over. I saw her once every three weeks for a whole year for one issue or another. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s because of that darned office building,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of those sick buildings&#x2013;you know, the kind that has no windows. We&#x2019;re all breathing the same air all the time. We&#x2019;re constantly passing colds on to each other.&#x201d; It never occurred to Catherine that the fact that she never exercised and ate poorly could be the source of her illnesses. She was always looking for a quick fix for her problems, requesting prescriptions for antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications. <br><br>Although I could appreciate her frustration, I believed Catherine&#x2019;s workplace had nothing to do with her situation. She was suffering from a disorder that often lies hidden and goes undiagnosed&#x2013;a condition called oxidative stress. At first she resisted my suggestions that a healthier lifestyle might be her ticket to a better life. But after a frustrating year of illness, Catherine finally agreed to try the Ten Years Younger Diet for a month and to work out at the local gym at least four days a week. <br><br>A month went by, and to my surprise, Catherine hadn&#x2019;t called once. After about two months of silence, I became concerned. I called her, to be sure nothing terrible had happened. <br><br>&#x201c;How have you been?&#x201d; I asked Catherine. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen you for a while, and I was worried.&#x201d; <br><br>Fortunately, my fears proved unfounded. &#x201c;Oh, Dr. Masley, I feel wonderful,&#x201d; Catherine responded. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t felt this well in ten years!&#x201d; <br><br>What is oxidative stress&#x2013;the mysterious ailment that laid Catherine so low for so long? It&#x2019;s a natural process in our bodies that underlies much of what ages us. In fact, many of the suggestions I&#x2019;ve included in the Ten Years Younger Program are meant to fight this thief that robs you of your energy, good health, and longevity. <br><br>Oxidative stress is the result of your body&#x2019;s inability to process free radicals, which are a by-product of your body&#x2019;s natural energy production. Every process that creates energy also makes waste products. Take your car, for example. It burns gas and oxygen to make energy, and exhaust is created as a by-product. These pollutants must be removed from the engine so that it can run well; that&#x2019;s what the tailpipe is for. The exhaust that comes out of the tailpipe is packed with pollutants&#x2013; you certainly wouldn&#x2019;t want to breathe it in. <br><br>Your body is no different, only in this case free radicals are the chemical exhaust. These biochemical compounds damage your living cells. But in addition to the free radicals you produce naturally, you also encounter others from outside sources: pesticides, drugs, pollutants, cigarettes, fumes, smog, tobacco smoke, lead, mercury, and cadmium. Every cell in your body takes between 10,000 and 100,000 aging hits from free radicals every day, and these micro-attacks injure your cells. <br><br>If your lifestyle doesn&#x2019;t protect you against the onslaught of free rad-icals&#x2013;oxidative stress&#x2013;you&#x2019;ll almost certainly suffer premature aging. Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance: You generate or encounter too many free radicals without taking in enough antioxidants, anti-aging biochemical compounds that are found in foods. They turn off free radicals the way a fire extinguisher puts out little fires, thus slowing aging and enhancing your health. These essential nutrients counteract the harmful free radicals your body encounters, and play a critical role in promoting a long and healthy life. <br><br>So how do free radicals make you age? They attack not only your cell membranes&#x2013;the outer walls of each cell in your body&#x2013;but also your DNA, causing mutations that impact the function of your cells. This assault may even transform a normal cell into one that is cancerous. In fact, most cancers develop from normal cells whose DNA has been damaged by free radicals and oxidative stress. Free radicals will also age your skin by destroying its structure and speeding the creation of wrinkles. In fact, many of the aging scenarios I&#x2019;ll cover in Chapter 2 are due directly to the effects of oxidative stress. If you&#x2019;re healthy, however, you will have enough antioxidants to extinguish free radicals, and the limited DNA damage that does occur can be easily repaired. <br><br>The Ten Years Younger Program will help you change and/or reverse the damage caused by oxidative stress and will continue to protect you in the future so that you remain healthy as the years go by. In Chapter 4, I provide a list of Vitality Foods with high antioxidant activity, and The Ten Years Younger Diet and recipes in Part III are rich in antioxidants as well. The Age-Busting Fitness regimen and the Relaxation Routine will also decrease your level of chronic oxidative stress. It is possible to overcome it, and I&#x2019;ll show you how. <br><br><b>Aging Accelerator #2: <br>Low-Carb, High-Protein, High-Fat Diets </b><br>Sharon had been on a popular low-carb diet for three months. The first month, she was delighted to find that, after giving up her cookies, coffee cake, and other high-carb treats, she had lost about 6 pounds. &#x201c;Only 24 pounds to go,&#x201d; she told herself, happily pulling on a size 12 dress for the first time in a year. <br><br>Her delight turned to disappointment two months later when she&#x2019;d lost only another 7 pounds. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re on a plateau,&#x201d; a fellow dieter reassured her, but try as she might, she couldn&#x2019;t shed another pound. What she did notice, though, was that her energy was flagging and she wasn&#x2019;t thinking as clearly as she used to. Then, to add insult to injury, her boyfriend, Teddy, complained that she had terrible breath. Even worse, once Teddy started his own low-carb diet program, he lost all interest in sex. Sharon didn&#x2019;t know why. Was it because she was tired all the time? Was it the bad breath? Maybe he didn&#x2019;t find her attractive anymore. Or was it him? Had the low-carb diet diminished his libido? <br><br>Soon, given all the unpleasant changes in her life, Sharon&#x2019;s favorite doughnuts were calling her name. And one day, discouraged, she answered. From that moment on, her low-carb diet was history. Sharon went on to regain all the weight she&#x2019;d lost, plus an extra 5 pounds. <br><br>For the past few years, we&#x2019;ve been living in the &#x201c;Age of Atkins,&#x201d; and low-carb consciousness has become a way of life for dieters and non-dieters alike. Many of you will be aware of two studies conducted by Frederick Samaha, M.D., and Gary Foster, Ph.D., that were published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> in 2003 and showed that an Atkins-like diet did in fact yield short-term modest weight loss in obese patients, but only when compared against an average American diet that was rich in refined sugar, low in fiber, and lacking in healthy fats. And within the year the results of the conventional diet and the Atkins diet were about the same. Furthermore, the fact that the Atkins diet did not succeed in achieving even a 10 percent weight loss in obese patients in either study suggests that this type of dietary intervention is a failure. To top it all off, the dropout rate in the studies was extremely high, as most people find it next to impossible to sustain this type of eating over the long haul. <br><br>But the effects of the low-carb diet are even more serious than most people realize, because it&#x2019;s not just pounds we&#x2019;re talking about. The truth is that yo-yo dieting (on one day, off the next) strongly contributes to accelerated aging. Not only are these diets difficult to tolerate, but they are actually dangerous and will make you old before your time. <i>Rather than melting away the pounds, these regimens are melting the years from your life</i>! Here&#x2019;s why: <br><br>� <i>Low-carb diets lack the fiber necessary to lower cholesterol and blood sugar. </i>Low-carb diets are notorious for pushing high-fat meats and cheeses, which have no fiber at all! Every day your body needs at least 30 grams of fiber (found in fruits, whole grains, vegetables, beans, and nuts). Fiber lowers your cholesterol by binding to it in your gut and preventing it from being absorbed into your bloodstream. It also slows the absorption of sugar from your intestines. This prevents insulin surges after meals and protects you from developing diabetes. Fiber also helps to remove toxins from your digestive tract that can cause low-grade inflammation throughout your body&#x2013;another major age accelerator (see below). <br><br>� <i>Low-carb diets lack antioxidants</i>. As I explained before, antioxidants are health-promoting biochemicals found in edible plants that actually slow the aging process in your cells. For instance, fibrous Vitality Foods such as apples, grapefruit, broccoli, and cauliflower prevent damage to your cells that can lead to cancer. <br><br>These antioxidant-rich foods extinguish free radicals before they do damage to your body. But low-carb diets shun these nutrient-rich foods, for reasons that defy true scientific thinking. Diets low in antioxidants also allow cholesterol to be quickly converted into artery-clogging plaque (I&#x2019;ll explain how in Chapter 2), and actually promote the death of brain cells. The 1 to 2 cups of salad allowed on low-carb diets just doesn&#x2019;t cut it&#x2013;and vitamins marketed to low-carb dieters supply only a tiny fraction of the vast array of nutrients found in high-fiber foods. <br><br>� <i>Low-carb diets are often loaded with saturated fats</i>. Some low-carb, high-protein diets encourage you to eat lots of red meat, bacon, and high-fat dairy products such as whipped cream, cheeses, and butter. These all contain high levels of saturated fats that clog your arteries. Clogged arteries are associated with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, amputation, and loss in brain function&#x2013;and you don&#x2019;t have to be over 50 to experience these very negative side effects. Furthermore, foods that are loaded with saturated fats are also often high in additives and pesticides that elevate your cancer risk. <br><br>� <i>Low-carb diets shrink your muscles and weaken exercise performance</i>. If you shed more than 2 to 3 pounds a week, you can be sure that you&#x2019;re losing more muscle than fat. Why? Because to burn fat, you need an enzyme called lipase, which only allows you to burn at most 2 to 3 pounds of fat a week. If you lose any more than that, you&#x2019;re clearly losing lean muscle mass instead. But when you yo-yo, as Sharon did, and go off the diet, you&#x2019;ll most likely gain back only the fat, not the muscle! A cycle of rapid weight loss (losing more muscle than fat) followed by weight regain (gaining more fat than muscle) leaves you with a higher percentage of body fat and a lower percentage of muscle mass. If you cycle on and off these diets several times, you may get flabbier, fatter, and weaker over time&#x2013;definitely not the desired result! <br><br>� <i>Low-carb diets can cause ketosis</i>. Very-low-carb diets can induce ketosis, a dangerous physical state that occurs with prolonged fasting and the eating of a diet restricted to high-fat, low-carb foods. When you&#x2019;re in a state of ketosis, you&#x2019;re essentially pouring battery acid-like compounds into your bloodstream. Not surprisingly, this makes you feel ill, and it also suppresses your appetite&#x2013;part of the gimmick behind the Atkins weight-loss claims. Unfortunately, ketosis is quite dangerous. It can destroy your brain cells as well as your kidneys (see below). And since ketosis increases acid production, it changes the pH level or acidity of your blood, which can further dull your brain function. <br><br>� <i>Low-carb diets can cause kidney failure</i>. Animal protein in moderation won&#x2019;t hurt your kidneys, but the sheer volume of animal protein in some low-carb diets can put significant stress on them. Excess protein is difficult to process, and while most kidneys can manage the added work, some can&#x2019;t. In particular, if you have diabetes or signs of metabolic syndrome (see Aging Accelerator #3, on page 12), your kidneys are more likely to be injured by excess protein. And ketosis appears to worsen this problem considerably. I&#x2019;ve seen patients who&#x2019;ve pushed themselves into ketosis over and over again in their attempts to lose weight and were later diagnosed with kidney failure. Although these patients did eventually drop the low-carb, high-protein, high-fat diet, their kidney function never recovered. Now they&#x2019;re facing kidney transplants. <br><br>� <i>Low-carb diets speed bone loss (osteoporosis)</i>. Low-carb diets are usually deficient in calcium and magnesium, two minerals critical for the health of your bones. But that&#x2019;s not the whole story. Excess animal protein (more than 6 to 8 ounces of meat, poultry, or fish daily) can also deplete calcium from your bones. Here&#x2019;s how: Animal protein is acidic, and the extra acid you take in from a diet high in animal protein can make your blood acidic too. Your body has a wonderful built-in mechanism to prevent this from happening: It sucks calcium from your bones to neutralize any changes in your blood&#x2019;s acidity. Unfortunately, the calcium that&#x2019;s now in your blood is passed out of your body in the urine, ultimately weakening your bones. Considering that average Americans don&#x2019;t come close to consuming enough calcium, people with a lifetime history of excessive animal protein intake risk spending their final years disabled in nursing homes with hip or spinal fractures.</p><h2>The Greatest Rock Guitar Fake Book</h2><p>(Fake Book).

Not only have they been a driving force behind the spread of liberal politics; they have also been steadfastly loyal to a doctrine that promised them both safety and political acceptance. Recent evidence suggests that their commitment has not waned. But while Jews continue to stand up for other groups and &#34;vote their conscience&#34;, contends Ruth Wisse, the liberal commitment to the Jews is not nearly so strong. Whenever Jews have been attacked - from the trial of Captain Dreyfus to the sustained military and political war against Israel - liberals have been slow to defend Jewish rights and have preferred instead to hold the Jews responsible for the persistence of their enemies. The explanation for this liberal default, Wisse argues, is the survival and success of anti-Semitism. This irrational idea continues to flourish throughout the world, despite the destruction of the fascist and communist regimes that were its deadliest twentieth-century allies. Wisse points out that anti-Semitism&#39;s astonishing resilience has put liberals - including liberal Jews - in an impossible position. The only reasonable response to such a doctrine, Wisse insists, is not appeasement or avoidance, but steadfast confrontation and rejection. Yet such opposition is alien to liberal ideas of open-mindedness and strikes many as intolerant. Unwilling to suspend their optimistic view of man as a benevolent and rational being in order to combat a mortal enemy, most liberals - including many Jews - conclude that Jews themselves must be responsible for the continuing wars against them - thus implicitly condoning their sacrifice. Wisse&#39;s book, inspired by afriend&#39;s emigration to Israel, traces the Jewish romance with liberalism from its discovery by Jewish integrationists and Zionists to the acceptance today by many Jews of a moral equivalence between Zionism and the war against it. She also explores, among the many contradictions of modern Jewish politics, the ambiguous question of Jewish &#34;chosenness&#34;, and the Jewish longing for acceptance in a larger human family; the successful Arab war of ideas against Israel; and the dilemma of Jewish writers and intellectuals who wish to transcend their parochializing siege. Above all, she shows how and why anti-Semitism became the twentieth century&#39;s most successful ideology and reveals what people in liberal democracies would have to do to prevent it from once again achieving its goal.Although it has since been retracted, in 1975 Arab leaders introduced the "Zionism equals racism" equation to the United Nations. Wisse views this move as part of an Arab propaganda campaign against Israel, which she believes the predominantly Arab states seek to annihilate. This ongoing campaign, Wisse writes, has caused Americans on the political left and right alike to reflexively blame Israel for Middle East problems. As a result, American liberals' support for Israeli rights has weakened, and Jews in the Diaspora can no longer seek refuge behind the banner of liberalism, she cautions. A professor of Yiddish and English literature at McGill University in Montreal, Wisse has produced an impassioned, hard-line polemic. Calling anti-Semitism "the most durable ideology of the twentieth century," she judges liberals' perennial hope that Arabs will turn friendly and tolerant of Israel to be misguided. She chides modern Israeli writers who, ambivalent about Zionism, "deliver up the image of the ugly Israeli." Her contentious essay is framed by a personal letter to an ex-lover who emigrated to Israel. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Woodstock: 50 Years of Peace and Music</h2><p><b>Giftable 50th anniversary commemorative with never-before-seen images and original interviews.

They hailed from the San Francisco Bay Area but stayed away from the region&#x2019;s trademark psychedelic jams. Instead, they focused on the three-minute single, and they were masters of the form. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We grew up listening to Top 40 radio, and so the three-minute single, two-and-a-half-minute single, was the format,&#x201d; said bassist Stu Cook.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that when they reached the festival grounds in Bethel, they saw a lot of familiar faces. The experience that they had backstage bore no resemblance to the one that the audience was having.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We hung out with Santana&#x2019;s people, the people from Bill Graham&#x2019;s organization took care of us,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We hung out with him and drank wine and smoked weed, ate great steaks. Backstage was a different world and a half from the audience, for sure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that Bill Graham&#x2019;s organization could not provide was a reprieve from the hours of delays that plagued the entire festival. Cook said that the band endured a wait of several hours before they could finally set foot on stage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There was a lot of technical difficulties throughout the evening,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We were supposed to play at ten on Saturday night, and I don&#x2019;t think we got on the stage until after one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to those who saw it, their set was a great one. Many audience members said it was one of the best performances of the weekend.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Creedence was perfect,&#x201d; said Mark Yessin, who was twenty when he watched their set. &#x201c;I thought the performance was great.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The band does not appear in the documentary or on the soundtrack. Cook said that singer and guitarist John Fogerty refused to allow it on the grounds that the band had played too poorly. Cook was adamant that he was wrong about that.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We had some technical problems at the start of the set,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They were worked out, but I know John was irritated to no end about the problems that he was having, so maybe that caused him to have a different take on the evening. But we really did deliver that night. It was one of those not-ideal circumstances, but you try and rise to the occasion, and I believe we did.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the set was over, the group left for their next concert. The contrast between that event and Woodstock could not have been clearer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We played the next day in a large circus tent with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band somewhere in New Jersey,&#x201d; Cook said. &#x201c;One night you&#x2019;re playing to half a million people, the next night you&#x2019;re playing to maybe five thousand or less. It was night and day for sure. It was like, &#x2018;Wow, we just played for half a million people, and now we can count everybody here.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three months later, the group released their fourth studio album, Willy and the Poor Boys, which was their third of 1969. Contemporary reviews called it their crowning achievement, but despite the accolades, the group only had three records left in them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guitarist Tom Fogerty, John Fogerty&#x2019;s older brother, left in 1970, and in 1972, they released <i>Mardi Gras</i>, their final album. The record was savaged by such critics as Rolling Stone&#x2019;s Jon Landau, who called it, in a scathing review, &#x201c;the worst album I have ever heard from a major rock band.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group disbanded in October 1972, in a famously bitter breakup over such issues as management woes and personal problems among band members. Even the death of Tom Fogerty in 1990 couldn&#x2019;t make a dent in the acrimony, and when the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, John Fogerty refused to perform with them, according to <i>Ultimate Classic Rock.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the lingering bad feelings, Cook said that the music he made with the group will endure long after those details are forgotten.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a very unhappy story, what started out as junior high school buddies playing in a rock and roll band, to the heights that we achieved for a period,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But the music lives on, and it&#x2019;s definitely a good catalog. So at least we didn&#x2019;t screw that part up.&#x201d;</p><h2>Pezzettino</h2><p><b>A classic fable about the search for identity, from Caldecott Honor winning picture book creator Leo Lionni.</b><br><br>Pezzettino lives in a world in which everyone is big and does daring and wonderful things.

She was a respected senior professor of English who had celebrated her fiftieth birthday a month before. As she crested a hill, she caught a branch in the spokes of her bicycle, which instantly pitched her to the pavement. Her chin took the full force of the blow, and her head snapped back. In that instant, she was paralyzed.</p><p>In A Body, Undone, Crosby puts into words a broken body that seems beyond the reach of language and understanding. She writes about a body shot through with neurological pain, disoriented in time and space, incapacitated by paralysis and deadened sensation. To address this foreign body, she calls upon the readerly pleasures of narrative, critical feminist and queer thinking, and the concentrated language of lyric poetry. Working with these resources, she recalls her 1950s tomboy ways in small-town, rural Pennsylvania, and records growing into the 1970s through radical feminism and the affirmations of gay liberation.</p><p>Deeply unsentimental, Crosby communicates in unflinching prose the experience of "diving into the wreck" of her body to acknowledge grief, and loss, but also to recognize the beauty, fragility, and dependencies of all human bodies. A memoir that is a meditation on disability, metaphor, gender, sex, and love, A Body, Undone is a compelling account of living on, as Crosby rebuilds her body and fashions a life through writing, memory, and desire.</p></p><p><b>Christina Crosby </b>is a Professor of English and Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Wesleyan University. She is the author of The Ends of History: Victorians and the 'Woman Question' (1991) and has published essays and reviews in Victorian Studies, PMLA, College English, and elsewhere."Crosby weaves poetry and literary references into her her story in an attempt to find meaning in her life. Her poignant, well-written, and thoughtful memoir will be of interest to scholars in feminist, gay, and disability studies."

(<i>Feministing.com</i>)<br><br>"Perhaps the most profound lesson of Crosby's book is how lonely pain is...[she] is not the person whose suffering can be made into a vessel for other people's metaphors. Her book's drama lies in trying to decode who she really is."

(<i>Elle</i>)<br><br>"[A Body, Undone]is fascinating and painful, humiliating and beautiful...There's no bitterness in these pages, no anger at the action that led to her injury." (<i>Mediander.com</i>)<br><br>"Our sense of ourselves cannot exist outside our bodies. As such, Crosby's act of writing the body is a powerful act of self-preservation." (<i>Inside Higher Ed.</i>)<br><br>"Crosby discusses her reality with a candor that must be experienced to be believed.

Levitt,author of American Jewish Loss after the Holocaust)<br><br>"Most memoirs about life with a disability 'almost always move toward a satisfying conclusion of lessons learned, Crosby writes.

A gentle, hands-on method of evaluating and enhancing the function of the craniosacral system &#x2014; the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord &#x2014; CST boosts the body&#x2019;s natural healing processes and has proven efficacious for a wide range of medical problems from migraines, learning disabilities, and post-traumatic stress disorder to fibromyalgia, chronic neck and back pain, and TMJ. This book provides a broad introduction to this therapy by way of short pieces written by a number of well-known practitioners or experts. In addition to pioneer John E. Upledger, contributors include Richard Grossinger (<i>Planet Medicine</i>), Don Ash <i>(Lessons from the Sessions),</i> Don Cohen <i>(An Introduction to Craniosacral Therapy),</i> and Bill Gottlieb <i>(Alternative Cures).</i> Each selection covers a different aspect of CST: what it is, what it does, how it heals, what the practitioner does during a CST session, CST&#x2019;s relationship to cranial osteopathy and other healing therapies, as well as other topics of interest to the beginner.</p><p>John E. Upledger, DO, OMM, began developing CranioSacral Therapy in the 1970s. In 1985, he founded the Upledger Institute, the most comprehensive source of training in CST. The author of <i>CranioSacral Therapy: Touchstone for Natural Healing </i>and <i>SomatoEmotional Release,</i> he lives in Palm Beach Gardens, FL.&#x201c;Why should it surprise us that we can tap into the body&#x2019;s own inner wisdom to facilitate a positive response through the use of our hands and an innate desire to help? In my mind, this is health as it was meant to be&#x2014;a natural collaboration between two human beings on a multitude of different levels, all simply allowing the body to do what it was born to do best.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;John E. Upledger, from the Introduction<br><br>&#x201c;I have long sought an introduction to craniosacral therapy for those who don&#x2019;t know what it is or imagine it has to do with spinal injury or is only for sick people. In fact, CST is a natural manual medicine, preventive as well as curative, psychological and emotional as well as anatomical and somatic. Much as Iceland contains powerful underground shear forces and vital fluids, so does the human body. Their balance and release affect every aspect of life.

They need to listen to the stories of those who experience SSA and the stories of those who have accompanied them on their journeys. They also need to ground their responses in a genuine Christian understanding of the human person and of human sexuality.</p><p>This volume includes essays that lay out the Christian view of the human person and of human sexuality, essays that challenge the bifurcation of sexualities into "heterosexual" and "homosexual".&nbsp; Topics include an explanation of the meaning of the word "disorder", a discussion of the therapeutic power of friendship, and an application of Saint John Paul II&#x2019;s personalism to the question of same-sex attraction.&nbsp; Psychologists and counselors explain various ways of affirming those who experience SSA and of leading them to experience the power of Christ&#x2019;s healing love. Several of those who experience SSA tell their touching and inspiring stories.</p></p><p><p><b>Janet Smith, Ph.D.</b> is author or editor of numerous books on ethics, including <i>Why Humanae Vitae Was Right</i>, <i>Living the Truth in Love</i> (with Father Paul Check), and <i>The Right to Privacy</i>.

Freckles was discovered on the doorstep of a Chicago orphanage, badly beaten and missing a hand. He yearns for the fulfillment of&nbsp;useful work, and at Indiana's Limberlost Swamp, his grit and determination win him the difficult, dangerous job of guarding a valuable stand of timber. Faithful and brave in his daily tasks, Freckles comes to appreciate the beauty and majesty of the natural world amid the wetlands' sights, sounds, and silences.<br>As nature works&nbsp;miracles in the&nbsp;boy's lonely, starved heart, Freckles meets a kind and gentle girl who collects specimens for a wildlife photographer.

The soul stories in this revised volume take on a cross-generational orientation with emphasis on linking stories of family identities, events, relationships, and story plot with Bible stories and exemplary Christian faith stories found in the African Diaspora. This orientation builds on an awareness of the continued fragmentation of Black family life and the disconnect between generations on one hand, yet, on the other hand, the profound yearning of Black people for a common family history.&nbsp; The goal of Dr. Wimberly's model is to enliven the values associated with the image of "village" in order to empower and equip African Americans today.</p><p>Anne Streaty Wimberly proposes a method for educating Christians-the story-linking process. In Soul Stories: African American Christian Education she applies it specifically to the life experiences, history, and evolving liberation of African American Christians who are encouraged to see the connection between biblical stories, their own personal stories, and the stories of important African Americans in history. Christian education in African American contexts is strengthened by reclaiming the story-linking method that emerged naturally in the African American heritage.Anne E. Streaty Wimberly is Professor of Christian Education at the Interdenominational and Theological Center in Atlanta, Georgia. She has 37 years of teaching experience and has been involved in music instruction in all age levels from preschool through graduate level.</p><h2>The Sun Is Also a Star Movie Tie-in Edition</h2><p><p><b>The #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and National Book Award Finalist from the author of <i>Everything, Everything</i> is now a major motion picture starring Yara Shahidi and Charles Melton!

He is also the editor of the Library of America volume, <i>True Crime: An American Anthology</i>.&nbsp;He lives in Brooklyn and Mattituck, Long Island, with his wife, the poet Kimiko Hahn.<b>WHAT IT MEANS<br><br>ORIGIN OF THE TERM</b><br><br>One reason people tend to think that serial murder is a frighteningly new phenomenon is that, until about twenty years ago, no one ever heard of such a thing. For most of the twentieth century, the news media never referred to serial killers. But that isn't because homicidal psychos didn't exist in the past.<br><br>Indeed, one of the most infamous American serial killers of all time, Albert Fish, committed his atrocities around the time of the Great Depression. After his arrest, his unspeakable crimes were covered extensively by the newspapers. Nowhere, however, is Fish described as a serial killer. The reason is simple. The phrase hadn't been invented yet. Back then, the type of crime we now define as serial murder was simply lumped together under the general rubric of "mass murder."<br><br>Credit for coining the phrase "serial killer" is commonly given to former FBI Special Agent Robert Ressler, one of the founding members of the Bureau's elite Behavioral Science Unit (aka the "Mind Hunters" or the "Psyche Squad"). Along with his colleague John Douglas, Ressler served as a model for the character Jack Crawford in Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter trilogy.<br><br>In his 1992 memoir, Whoever Fights Monsters, Ressler writes that, in the early 1970s, while attending a weeklong conference at the British police academy, he heard a fellow participant refer to "crimes in series," meaning "a series of rapes, burglaries, arsons, or murders." Ressler was so impressed by the phrase that, upon returning to Quantico, he began to use the term "serial killer" in his own lectures to describe "the killing of those who do one murder, then another and another in a fairly repetitive way."<br><br>In thinking up the term, Ressler also says he had in mind the movie-matinee adventure serials of his boyhood: Spy Smasher, Flash Gordon, The Masked Marvel, etc. Like a child looking forward to the latest installment of his favorite cliffhanger, the serial killer can't wait to commit his next atrocity.<br><br>That is Ressler's version of how he came to invent the phrase that has now become such a vital part of our language. There is just one problem with the story. There is documented proof that the expression "serial murderer" existed at least a dozen years before Ressler supposedly invented it.<br><br>According to Jesse Sheidlower, editor of the major new revision of the Oxford English Dictionary, the term can be traced as far back as 1961, where it appears in a citation from Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary. The quote, which is attributed to the German critic Siegfried Kracauer, is:<br><br>[He] denies that he is the pursued serial murderer.<br><br>-first documented use of the term "serial murderer," as it appears in Merriam-Webster's 1961 Third New International Dictionary<br><br>By the mid-1960s, the term "serial murderer" had become common enough, at least overseas, that it was used repeatedly in the 1966 book The Meaning of Murder by the British writer John Brophy.<br><br>Jack the Ripper, still unidentified and still the most famous of all serial murderers, was not altogether true to type. The typical serial murderer kills once too often and gets caught.<br><br>-from The Meaning of Murder (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1966), p. 189<br><br>It's possible that, during his visit to England (where Brophy's book was originally published), Ressler picked up the term, perhaps subliminally. To give credit where it is due, it was evidently Ressler who altered the phrase from "serial murderer" to the slightly more punchy "serial killer."<br><br>In any event, if he can't really be credited with coining the expression, Ressler certainly helped introduce it into American culture. Surprisingly, it did not enter into common usage until quite recently. The earliest published example of the phrase "serial killer" that the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary have been able to come up with is only twenty years old. It comes from the article "Leading the Hunt in Atlanta's Murders" by M. A. Farber, published in the May 3, 1981, issue of the New York Times Magazine.<br><br>Here, reprinted for the first time, is the passage containing the first known published use of the term "serial killer":<br><br>Someone, raising a question that trails Brown from forum to forum, asks about race and the murders. Some Atlantans fear racial violence if a "serial" killer is discovered to be white.<br><br>DEFINITIONS<br><br>Since the term "serial killer" was invented to describe a specific type of criminal, you'd think the definition would be clear-cut. However, confusion surrounds the term. Even the experts can't agree.<br><br>Let's start with the official FBI definition:<br><br>Three or more separate events in three or more separate locations with an emotional cooling-off period between homicides.<br><br>-FBI Crime Classification Manual (1992)<br><br>This definition stresses three elements:<br><br>1.Quantity. There have to be at least three murders.<br><br>2.Place. The murders have to occur at different locations.<br><br>3.Time. There has to be a "cooling-off period"-an interval between the murders that can last anywhere from several hours to several years.<br><br>The last two characteristics are meant to differentiate serial killing from mass murder, in which a suicidal, rage-filled individual slaughters a bunch of people at once: a disgruntled employee, for example, who shows up at his office with an automatic weapon and blows away a half dozen coworkers before turning the gun on himself.<br><br>There are several problems with the FBI definition. In one respect, it's much too broad, since it can be applied to homicidal types who aren't serial killers: professional hit men, for example, or Western outlaws like William "Billy the Kid" Bonney, who is said to have gunned down twenty-one men before he reached the age of twenty-one. "Mad bombers" like Ted Kaczynski also meet the FBI's criteria. But none of these types match the common conception of a serial killer.<br><br>In another respect, the FBI definition is overly narrow, since it specifies that a serial killer has to commit his crimes "in three or more separate locations." To be sure, some serial killers range far and wide in their search for prey. Ted Bundy, for example, murdered women in several different states. Others, however, prefer to do their dirty work in one place. John Wayne Gacy, for example, turned the basement of his suburban split-level into a private torture chamber and even disposed of his victims' remains at home, stashing them in the crawl space until he ran out of room.<br><br>The main defect in the FBI definition however, is what's missing from it-namely, any sense of the specific nature of the crimes. When Siegfried Kracauer first used the term "serial murderer," he was discussing the character played by Peter Lorre in Fritz Lang's classic movie, M: a repulsive, moon-faced pervert who preys on little girls. A few years later, John Brophy used it to describe killers like Jack the Ripper and Earle Leonard Nelson, the infamous "Gorilla Murderer" of the 1920s who strangled and raped several dozen women across the United States and up into Canada. And when Robert Ressler and his colleagues in the Behavioral Science Unit adopted the term in the 1970s, they applied it to homicidal psychopaths like Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, and Edmund Kemper. In all these cases, there was one common thread: a strong component of depraved sexuality.<br><br>Recognizing this fact, some experts stress the sexual motivations behind serial murder, defining it as the act of ultraviolent deviants, who get twisted pleasure from inflicting extreme harm on their victims and who will keep on committing their atrocities until they are stopped.<br><br>Of course, there are criminals who match this profile but who can't be considered serial killers for one simple reason: they are caught after committing a single homicide. An example is James Lawson, described in the book The Evil That Men Do by Stephen Michaud and former FBI Special Agent Roy Hazelwood (another member of the FBI's original Mind Hunter team).<br><br>A convicted rapist, Lawson was sent to a California state mental institution, where he struck up a friendship with a fellow inmate, James Odom. The two men began sharing their fantasies of rape and murder, encouraging each other's sickest impulses and forming a bond based on their mutual depravity. No sooner were they released than they decided to put their dreams into action. Abducting a twenty-five-year-old female convenience store clerk, they drove her to an isolated location. First Odom raped her in the backseat while Lawson watched.<br><br>Then Lawson went to work on her with his knife.<br><br>I wanted to cut her body so she would not look like a person, and destroy her so she would not exist. I began to cut on her body. I remember cutting her breasts off. After this, all I remember is that I kept cutting on her body.<br><br>-James Lawson<br><br>Fortunately, the two men were traced and arrested in short order. However, Lawson's case raises an interesting question. There's no doubt that he had the mentality of a serial killer; his confession makes that brutally clear. How many women would he have had to butcher before qualifying for that label? "Three or more," according to the FBI definition. But that number seems arbitrary. Let's suppose that, over the span of several weeks, the police in a small California town had found the remains of two female victims, killed and mutilated in the same way. Wouldn't they be justified in suspecting that a serial killer was on the loose?<br><br>These flaws in the FBI definition are rectified in another, more flexible one formulated by the National Institutes of Justice, which many authorities regard as a more accurate description:<br><br>A series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone. The crimes may occur over a period of time ranging from hours to years. Quite often the motive is psychological, and the offender's behavior and the physical evidence observed at the crime scenes will reflect sadistic, sexual overtones.<br><br>-National Institutes of Justice<br><br>CATEGORIES OF CARNAGE: SERIAL/MASS/SPREE<br><br>Though people sometimes confuse the terms and use them interchangeably, there are important differences between serial murder and the other major types of multiple homicide, mass murder and spree killing.<br><br>For the most part, serial murder is a sex crime, a fact that accounts for its distinctive features. The classic pattern of serial murder is a grotesque travesty of normal sexual functioning.<br><br>Most people who haven't had sex for a while begin to crave it more and more. They daydream about it. In vulgar terms, they grow increasingly horny. If unattached, they eventually seek out a willing partner. Once they've gratified their sexual urges, the need subsides for a certain period of time.<br><br>In a parallel way, the serial killer spends his time fantasizing about dominance, torture, and murder. In effect, he grows horny for blood. When his twisted desires get too strong to resist, he goes prowling for unwitting prey. His excitement reaches a climax with the suffering and death of the victim. Afterward, he experiences a "cooling-off" period. (This is somewhat of a misnomer since it is during this lull between crimes that the killer's bloodlust begins to build again. It would be more accurate to describe it as a "cooling-off/heating-up" period.) During this time, he may make use of "trophies" he has taken from a murder scene to relive the crime in his mind, savoring the memory of his victim's suffering.<br><br>In short, their unspeakable acts are a source of supreme pleasure to serial killers, who achieve the highest pitch of arousal-even to the point of orgasm-by inflicting savage harm on other human beings. Because doing terrible things feels so good to them, serial killers try not to get caught, so they can keep on enjoying their atrocities for as long as possible.<br><br>Mass Murder<br><br>Apart from the fact that they both involve multiple homicides, mass murder and serial killing have almost nothing in common.<br><br>Whereas the serial killer is often described as a predator, the mass murderer is stereotypically defined as a "human time bomb." Though there have been a number of female mass murderers, the great preponderance are male. In general, the mass murderer is someone whose life has come unraveled-who has been thrown out by his wife or fired from his job or suffered some other humiliating blow that pushes him over the edge. Filled with an annihilating rage at everything he blames for his failure, he explodes in a burst of devastating violence that wipes out everyone within range (a phenomenon that has entered slang as "going postal," a sardonic tribute to the number of US Postal Service workers who seem to have perpetrated such acts).<br><br>If serial murder is, in essence, a sex crime, mass murder is almost always a suicidal one. In blind, apocalyptic fury, the mass murderer has decided to go out with a bang and take as many people with him as possible. Typically, once the bloodbath is over, the mass murderer will either end his own life or provoke a fatal shoot-out with the police ("suicide by cop," as it is called).<br><br>Someday before I kill myself, I'll bring some people down with me.<br><br>-Sylvia Seegrist, mass murderer<br><br>Since his intention is to blow away as many people as possible, the mass murderer almost always uses firearms. This is in marked contrast to most<br><br>serial killers, who (with notable exceptions like David "Son of Sam" Berkowitz and Zodiac) prefer the sadistic "hands-on" thrill of stabbing, strangling, mauling, and mutilating.<br><br>A key element of mass murder is that, by definition, it occurs in a single location. Indeed, it is this factor, as much as anything else, that amounts for the devastating nature of the crime. The mass murderer is someone who-like a suicide bomber-detonates without warning in a restaurant, a playground, a schoolroom, an office, or even (as in the 1999 case of Larry Gene Ashbrook) a church, turning a safe, familiar setting into the scene of a corpse-strewn massacre.<br><br>Though mass murderers don't exert the same morbid fascination as serial killers-largely because their crimes are less sensationally gruesome and sexually perverted-they often run up substantial body counts. Charles Whitman, for example-the Texas Tower sniper who, on August 1, 1966, barricaded himself on the observation deck overlooking the University of Texas campus and began picking off people below-killed fourteen victims in the course of his massacre. And even this grim total was surpassed by the case of James Huberty, one of the worst mass-murder episodes of modern times.<br><br>James Huberty and the McDonald's Massacre<br><br>The site was significant: a suburban McDonald's restaurant. This all-American symbol of happy family life and material satisfaction represented everything that James Oliver Huberty had struggled so hard-and failed so miserably-to achieve.<br><br>His life had been difficult from the start. His mother, a religious zealot, became a missionary and abandoned her family when James was only seven. Raised by his father, he grew up lonely and resentful, a boy whose sole companion was his dog and whose only interest was guns.</p><h2>Numbers: An Exegetical and Theological Exposition of Holy Scripture (The New American Commentary)</h2><p>THE NEW AMERICAN COMMENTARY is for the minister or Bible student who wants to understand and expound the Scriptures.

Hudson&#x2019;s Department Store on Woodward Avenue was more than just a store&#x2015;it was a Detroit icon and a world-class cultural treasure. At 25 stories, it was the world&#x2019;s tallest department store, and was at one time home to the most exceptional offerings in shopping, dining, services, and entertainment. The store prided itself on stocking everything from grand pianos to spools of thread. In addition to departments offering fashionable clothing and home furnishings, the original Hudson&#x2019;s store featured an auditorium, a circulating library, dining rooms, barber shops, a photo studio, holiday exhibits, a magnificent place called Toytown, and the world&#x2019;s largest American flag. As a legendary symbol of urban and entrepreneurial American history, the J.L. Hudson&#x2019;s Department Store earned a permanent place in Detroit&#x2019;s collective memory.

Beginning humbly with small-scale commercial fishing, seal hunting and passenger charters, the Eatons gradually developed a unique resort that came to be popular among writers, film companies and people from all over the country. Working from her diary and her memories, Mrs. Eaton wrote this extraordinary story of her life over a period of many years, until her death in 1947. She is remembered by her daufghter, Vera Eaton Amey, as a fearless and compassionate women. Mrs. Amey has done admirably well in sorting through mountains of letters, clippings and photographs to organize her mother&#39;s manuscript. She has also painstakingly consulted other sources to confirm, as much as possible, the accuracy of these recollections. With the passage of time- half a century and more- corroboration becomes increasingly difficult, and inconsistencies have inevitably crept in. The reader who would use &#34;Diary of a Sea Captains Wife&#34; as a historical reference is asked to bear this in mind. The true significance of Margaret Eaton&#39;s story lies in its appeal as the personal account of a woman living in a man&#39;s world, in a time and place remote from today&#39;s urban society.

To a young Jane Jacobs, Greenwich Village, with its winding cobblestone streets and diverse makeup, was everything a city neighborhood should be. But consummate power broker Robert Moses, the father of many of New York&#x2019;s most monumental development projects, thought neighborhoods like Greenwich Village were badly in need of &#x201c;urban renewal.&#x201d; Standing up against government plans for the city, Jacobs marshaled popular support and political power against Moses, whether to block traffic through her beloved Washington Square Park or to prevent the construction of the Lower Manhattan Expressway, an elevated superhighway that would have destroyed centuries-old streetscapes and displaced thousands of families. By confronting Moses and his vision, Jacobs forever changed the way Americans understood the city. Her story reminds us of the power we have as individuals to confront and defy reckless authority.</p><p>Anthony Flint is the director of public affairs at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a think-tank on land and development issues located in Cambridge, MA, and was a reporter at <i>The Boston Globe</i> for sixteen years.

As the doors opened, she watched as a crowd poured out, moving past pretty mosaics to the exit.<br><br>She had moved to New York from her hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and had joined her sister, Betty, in a small apartment in Brooklyn a few months before. She was hunting for a job, but the morning's interview had concluded swiftly, so she'd decided to explore her new city. She darted out before the doors slid shut and made her way through the turnstile and up a set of stairs to the street. Without knowing it, Jane had alighted in the heart of Greenwich Village, the place she would call home for decades to come.<br><br>As she emerged, she immediately noticed that the streets ran off at odd angles in all directions. She saw storefronts with awnings shading cluttered sidewalks, kids chasing one another in front of a grocery, delivery trucks stopping and starting their way up the street. Walking north on Seventh Avenue, she saw the skyscrapers of midtown in the distance and, when she turned around, the cluster of tall buildings in the financial district to the south. But in this spot most buildings were two or three stories, and few were higher than five or six. They were simple: no grand entrances, no soaring edifices. She gazed at shopwindows full of leather handbags and watches and jewelry, strolled past barbershops and caf�s, and ran her fingers over the daily newspapers stacked high in front of shelves inside filled with candy and cigars. Everywhere she looked she saw people-people talking to one another, it seemed, every few feet, among them longshoremen headed to taverns at the end of their shifts, casually dressed women window-shopping, old men with hands clasped on canes sitting on the benches in a triangular park. Mothers sat on stoops watching over it all. Everyone looked, she thought, the way she felt: unpretentious, genuine, living their lives. This was home.<br><br>Arriving at her Brooklyn apartment that evening, Jane described the wonders of the neighborhood she had seen, concluding simply, "Betty, I found out where we have to live."<br><br>"Where is it?" Betty asked.<br><br>"I don't know, but you get in the subway and you get out at a place called Christopher Street."<br><br>Jane had moved to New York City in 1934. Armed with a high-school diploma, a recently acquired knowledge of shorthand, and the wisdom of a few months working in the newsroom of a Scranton newspaper, she hoped to break into journalism. She knew it wasn't going to be easy to succeed in a business dominated by men; her assignments in Scranton had been limited to covering weddings, social events, and the meetings of women's civic organizations with names like the Women of the Moose and the Ladies' Nest of Owls No. 3. It was the thick of the Great Depression, and any job was difficult to come by.<br><br>Her older sister, Betty, twenty-four, had warned her. Betty had come to New York a few years before with hopes of finding work as an interior designer, but was now grateful to have a job as a salesgirl in the home furnishings section of the Abraham &amp; Straus department store. The headstrong Jane came to the big city anyway, joining her sister in the top floor of a six-floor walk-up in Brooklyn Heights, a neighborhood of Greek and Gothic Revival mansions and Italianate brownstones at the edge of the East River, overlooking Manhattan.<br><br>Within weeks of arriving, Jane realized that breaking into journalism was going to take time and that, in the meantime, she'd need to support herself. She began poring over employment agency listings looking for any clerical position she could find, and soon settled into a routine. Each morning she would walk from her apartment building, across the Brooklyn Bridge, and into lower Manhattan, where most of her interviews took place. The rest of her day would be spent exploring the city; she would invest a nickel for a subway ride and get out at random stops. She had been to New York only once before, as a girl of twelve, and now, at eighteen, she was drinking in the sights and sounds of a metropolis that could not be more different from Scranton.<br><br>Greenwich Village seemed to capture all the promise of moving to New York City for the young bespectacled girl from eastern Pennsylvania. As soon as she could, Jane brought her sister to Greenwich Village. Betty shared her enthusiasm for the neighborhood, and they quickly found an apartment on Morton Street, just south of the Christopher Street subway station. Morton Street was a classic Greenwich Village lane, running four blocks from east to west from the Hudson River, bending at a forty-five-degree angle in glorious violation of the orderly street grid of the rest of Manhattan. It was lined with petite trees, front-yard gardens, iron fences, and stately rows of four- and five-story brownstones and town houses.<br><br>Their neighbors there ranged from truckers and railway workers to artists, painters, and poets, including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and e. e. cummings. The White Horse Tavern, which for decades had been a gathering place for the bohemians of Greenwich Village, stood just around the corner on Hudson Street.<br><br>As excited as they were to be there, money was tight. After paying the rent, Jane and Betty had so little to spare that they resorted to mixing Pablum, a nutritious but notably bland cereal for infants, with milk for sustenance.<br><br>Their father's advice proved to be wise counsel in this time: that while the girls should pursue the careers of their dreams, they should also learn a practical skill to fall back on. The degree from the Powell secretarial and stenography school in Scranton gave Jane enough of an edge in the barren job market that after months of searching, she finally landed a job as a secretary for a candy manufacturing company. She would serve in similar clerical positions at a clock maker and a drapery hardware business in the years that followed. In her off time, she worked toward her dream career, honing her journalistic skills.<br><br>On those afternoons exploring the city after job interviews, and in her off-hours once she started working, she had begun writing down her observations of the city. In time she began to work them into articles. Early on she noticed that every few blocks of the city seemed to have a specialty trade-a little economy all their own. She sought to learn everything she could about these trades, striking up conversations with the shopkeepers and workers pushing racks of furs down the streets, and the leather makers in the deep back rooms into which she peered. Buckets of flowers on the sidewalk would prompt her to probe into the cut-flower trade; wandering through the diamond district on the Bowery on Manhattan's scrappy Lower East Side, she familiarized herself with the intricate system of jewelry auctions.<br><br>Immediately upon arriving home from work, she would toss her handbag on the sofa and settle in front of her manual typewriter in her room and write. After a while, she began to submit her pieces to popular magazines of the day. Much to her surprise, she arrived home one evening to find an envelope from an editor at Vogue who wanted to publish a story she had written on the fur district. The editors liked her plainspoken style and keen observations and wished to retain her as a freelance contributor. They proposed that she write four essays over the next two years, for which they would pay her $40 per article, a slightly better rate than the $12 per week she was making as a secretary. Her career as a writer in New York City had officially begun.<br><br>Her early journalism reflected an eye for the detail and the drama beneath the quotidian. A 1937 piece on the flower market in lower Manhattan, titled "Flowers Come to Town," began with a typical flourish:<br><br>All the ingredients of a lavender-and-old-lace love story, with a rip- roaring, contrasting background, are in New York's wholesale flower district, centered around Twenty-Eighth Street and Sixth Avenue. Under the melodramatic roar of the "El," encircled by hash-houses and Turkish baths, are the shops of hard-boiled, stalwart men, who shyly admit that they are dottles for love, sentiment, and romance.<br><br>She went on to describe in detail the 5:00 a.m. arrival of orchids, gardenias, peonies, and lilacs from Connecticut, Long Island, and New Jersey that were then meted out into buckets for sale by retailers. She considered the city's voracious demand for cut flowers and foliage-200 million ferns, 150,000 roses a day from just one grower in a season. It made sense when she thought about it: office reception areas, wedding receptions, society functions, and funerals all needed flowers. It was a big market, but the competition was fierce; she noted how the merchants adopted a set of rules to maintain a level playing field, such as agreeing not to open hampers in the flower market until 6:00 a.m., at the sound of a gong. She was fascinated not only with the mores of the city but with the way systems seemed to self-organize to prosper.<br><br>In another article, Jane wrote about the diamond district, which in the 1930s was centered on the Bowery across from the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She described how the dealers in their beards and hats jotted down notes on the cut stones, rings, necklaces, and lockets that pawnbrokers had sent for display at auction, then made their bids with silent gestures or by squeezing the auctioneer's arm. "Upstairs, in the small light rooms over the stores, diamonds are cut and polished and set or re-set, and silver is buffed. The doors and vestibules to the rooms are barred and there is no superfluous furniture, just the tools and tables where the skillful workmen sit with leather hammocks to catch the chips and dust of diamond and metal," she wrote. "Silver is polished against a cloth-covered revolving wheel . . . All the sweepings are carefully saved to be refined and the silver recovered. The walls and ceilings are brushed and the old oilcloth coverings and work clothes of the men are burned to extract the silver dust. Even the water in which the workmen wash their hands is saved. A small room where silver is polished may yield to a refiner hundreds of dollars worth of metal a year." Outside, meanwhile, is the "lusty tumultuous life of the lower East Side"-the rumble of the elevated subway, "Chinamen from Mott Street," exotic aromas, and bums on the curbstones.<br><br>In those first years in New York, Jane worked forty hours a week, typing, filing, and taking dictation. All the while she continued to scout the far reaches of the city, writing for Vogue as well as other periodicals. On one outing she turned her attention to manhole covers, decoding their cryptic inscriptions in order to map the underground rivers of electricity and gas lines, the tributaries of brine to chill the storage areas of produce markets, and the pipes carrying steam to heat skyscrapers. Her account of this subterranean maze, which showed how urban life was made possible by what was underneath, appeared in a New York magazine called Cue, which primarily published theater and restaurant listings. She also wrote feature stories for the Sunday Herald Tribune.<br><br>She began to range beyond purely urban subjects, writing about the way fishing boats operated in Chesapeake Bay, the pagan origins of Christmas, and the decorative buttons on military uniform sleeves (originally meant to keep soldiers from using them to wipe their noses). She even tried her hand at short stories, in one piece depicting the decapitation of James Madison in a creative rewriting of American history-"bump, bump, bump" went the founding father's head on the floor, she wrote. An editor at Reader's Digest deemed the piece "too gruesome for us," and apparently other editors reacted in a similar fashion. Jacobs experimented with science fiction, too, writing a story about fast-growing plants with fantastical intentions that similarly went unsold.<br><br>But writing about the city remained her passion. She often went up to the rooftop of her apartment building and watched the garbage trucks as they made their way through the city streets, picking the sidewalks clean. She would think, "What a complicated great place this is, and all these pieces of it that make it work." The more she investigated and explored neighborhoods, infrastructure, and business districts for her stories, the more she began to see the city as a living, breathing thing-complex, wondrous, and self-perpetuating.<br><br>As she approached her fourth year in New York, Jane began to reconsider her opinion on higher education. It had become clear to her that she needed a boost to get a full-time job as a journalist. From a young age she had rebelled against what she viewed as the insipid curriculum of the Scranton schools, and scorned her teachers, whom she considered dim-witted. She was known to stick her tongue out when teachers' backs were turned and to challenge her teachers routinely. When a fourth-grade teacher claimed that cities formed only around rivers with waterfalls to provide electric power, Jane pointed out that Scranton had a waterfall but it had nothing to do with powering the city or the economy of the place. Another teacher asked her students to promise to brush their teeth every day. But Jane's father had just told her never to make a promise unless she was absolutely certain she could keep it. So she refused and urged her fellow students to do the same. The teacher kicked her out of the classroom, and Jane wandered along empty railroad tracks on her way home for lunch.<br><br>Now, in 1938, she used money from her parents to enroll at Columbia University's School of General Studies, more than a hundred blocks north of Greenwich Village, which had open enrollment for "nontraditional" students-those who had interrupted their education or needed to attend part-time. The school's lack of a set curriculum appealed to Jacobs.<br><br>At Columbia, she signed up for courses in any subject that interested her-chemistry, geography, geology, law, political science, psychology, and zoology. Before long she was enjoying school for the first time, feeding her curiosity about how the world worked. By 1940, with good grades and a pile of credits to her name, she was poised to earn a degree not from the School of General Studies, which was open to all, but from Barnard, Columbia University's distinguished college for women, the equivalent of Radcliffe at Harvard. To do so, however, she would have to take a few mandatory courses. Citing her lackluster high-school record, college officials told her she couldn't waive the requirements. Jane walked away in a huff and never looked back.<br><br>"Fortunately, my [high school] grades were so bad they wouldn't have me and I could continue to get an education," Jacobs said later-an education in the real world, that is. From that point on, Jacobs would scoff at academic credentials, rebuff universities seeking to give her honorary degrees, and refuse to be called an "expert" in print.</p><h2>The Underground Is Massive: How Electronic Dance Music Conquered America</h2><p><p>Joining the ranks of <em>Please Kill Me</em> and <em>Can&#x2019;t Stop Won&#x2019;t Stop</em> comes this definitive chronicle of one of the hottest trends in popular culture&#x2014;electronic dance music&#x2014;from the noted authority covering the scene.</p><p>It is the sound of the millennial generation, the music &#x201c;defining youth culture of the 2010s&#x201d; (<em>Rolling Stone</em>).

In the late after�noon, before scarlet ibis bloodied the view of sunset, light flooded the stained-glass windows of Bird Hill Church of God in Christ, illuminating the renderings of black saints from Jesus to Absalom Jones. When there wasn&#x2019;t prayer meeting, choir rehearsal, Bible study, or Girl Guides, the church was empty except for its caretaker, Mr. Jeremiah. It was his job to chase the children away from the cem�etery that sloped down behind the church, his responsibility to shoo them from their perches on graves that dotted the backside of the hill the area was named for. Despite his best intentions, Mr. Jeremiah&#x2019;s noontime and midnight devotionals at the rum shop brought on long slumbers, when children found freedom to do as they liked among the dead.<br><br>Dionne Braithwaite was two weeks fresh from Brooklyn, and Barbados&#x2019;s fierce sun had already transformed her skin from its New York shade of caramel to a brick red.

Nineteen girls and one boy had died before the hill folks abandoned their suspicion of the world in general and doctors in particular to seek help from &#x201c;outside people.&#x201d; This was just one of the stories that Dionne and Phaedra&#x2019;s mother sum�moned as evidence for why she left the hill the first chance she got.<br><br>Phaedra and her sister arrived from Brooklyn at the beginning of the summer.

Her smile is brilliant. Her wave is flawless. She even wears a tiara. Everyone loves a tiara. And Cupcake wants everyone to love her.

She works hard to make sure she is beloved by all the other sweet treats. Being popular takes a lot of work as Cupcake rolls the wrinkles out of her paper baking liner, gets a new icing application, and makes sure that no sprinkle is out of place. Unfortunately, Cupcake starts alienating her former admirers with her constant quest for adoration. Maybe Cupcake doesn't need to be perfect for everyone after all. Each of the colorful bakery items has its own personality in this humorous tale. Puns abound, although some are more successful than others. The cinnamon bun "roll[s] his eyes," croissant can be a little "flaky," Coffee loves Cupcake "a latte," and at one point Cupcake feels "crummy." The message of acceptance is a bit muddled within the jokes, and there is an unnecessary romance between the fortune cookie and Cupcake, but by the conclusion it is clear that all of the bakery treats are friends and accepting of one another's flaws. Fans of DiPucchio and Wight's earlier offering, Everyone Loves Bacon, will be excited to see a bacon cameo.

Rather, "the end is reconciliation, the end is redemption, the end is the creation of the beloved community." King's words reflect the strong religious convictions that motivated the African American civil rights movement. As King and his allies saw it, "Jesus had founded the most revolutionary movement in human history: a movement built on the unconditional love of God for the world and the mandate to live in that love." Through a commitment to this idea of love and to the practice of nonviolence, civil rights leaders sought to transform the social and political realities of twentieth-century America. <br>In <i>The Beloved Community</i>, theologian and award-winning author Charles Marsh traces the history of the spiritual vision that animated the civil rights movement and shows how it remains a vital source of moral energy today. <i>The Beloved Community</i> lays out an exuberant new vision for progressive Christianity and reclaims the centrality of faith in the quest for social justice and authentic community.</p><p>"Half a century ago an underground army rallied around a vision in order to change the moral landscape of America. Part historian, part raconteur, and part preacher, Charles Marsh calls us to keep alive that vision and to fulfill its promise. I found myself both moved to nostalgia and stirred to action as I read his gripping account." -Philip Yancey, author of <i>What's So Amazing About Grace</i> <p> "What a magnificent book! Charles Marsh writes eloquently about 'lived theology' in the context of the civil rights movement and related social and religions endeavors such as Koinonia Farm near Americus, Georgia, which emphasized social justice, racial reconciliation and redemption. Read every word. You'll be enlightened, revived, and blessed." -Millard Fuller, Founder and President, Habitat for Humanity International</p><p> "Charles Marsh is one of our best theologians, one of our best historians, one of our best storytellers. In this book -- his most expansive and ambitious one to date -- he places the Christian faith of the civil rights movement in a larger context: he shows us the faith that drove that movement, but also shows that its energy is still potent today, among places and people that we pay insufficient attention to. Most important, Marsh articulates a vision for renewal, a way that the larger community of faith can recover its passion for true social justice. This is a vital book by a major American thinker." -Alan Jacobs, author of <i>Shaming the Devil</i> and <i>A Visit to Vanity Fair</i></p><p> "In this fascinating account of faith in action, Charles Marsh examines the necessity of hope, the seemingly contradictory truth that a vision of Christian transcendence animates lasting struggles for social change...<i>The Beloved Community</i> calls Christians back to a politics of empathy and social justice and activists back to the sustaining life of the faith. Marsh aims for nothing less here than the resurrection of the evangelical Christian left." -Grace Elizabeth Hale, Author of <i>Making Whiteness: The Culture of Segregation in the South, 1890-1940</i></p><p> "Charles Marsh brings the eloquence of a memoirist, the skill of a historian, and the insight of a theologian to this remarkable study of Christian faith and the pursuit of social justice in America. The stories Marsh tells are thrilling, and inspiring, and sometimes sad. This book will want to make you stand up and shout; and kneel and pray; and then go out and do something remarkable." -Lauren F.

Maha, a peasant woman from the Jordan Valley, and Um Saad from Amman find themselves sharing a room. After initial tensions they become friends and share their life stories. <p>Maha's version of history, which is told from the inside, is framed by the narrative of the storyteller who reports as an outsider. Maha's husband Harb was the love of her life but her devition to him does not survive the repression and violence of her husband bringing home a young new wife, Yusra.</p><p>The intricate structure of the novel with its different voices and interlacing narrative lines conforms to the ancient tradition of storytelling in Arabia. Both Muslim and Christian theological sources are used to create a mythical woman who is subjugated and confined by society. The apocalyptic vision of the novel refers to the continuing repression of Arab women whose daily contribution to the economy and struggle to survive in a male-dominated society have largely been neglected.</p></p><p>Fadia Faqir was born in Amman, Jordan in 1956. She is at present working on her third novel and teaching Arabic literature at Durham University Britain.This remarkable book by a brilliant Jordanian writer is part of Interlink&#39;s Emerging Voices: New International Fiction series, which also includes work from such other countries as Chile, Lebanon, Serbia, South Africa, Yemen and Turkey. Faqir&#39;s first novel, Nisanet (published by Viking), was hailed by critics for its &#34;passionate, breathtaking, masterful style and powerful storytelling.&#34; Clearly, Faqir has not slacked off in her new novel, Pillars of Salt. Here she interweaves ancient Arabic storytelling traditions, with Muslim and Christian theological sources and modern facts, to capture an alternative picture of Jordanian history - the continuing repression of Arab women whose daily contributions to the nation&#39;s economy and struggle for independence are stifled in a male-dominated society. This is the story of two women, a Bedouin peasant named Maha from the Jordan Valley, and Um Saad, wife of a prosperous butcher in Amman. They are forced to share a room in the Amman mental hospital to which they have been confined before and after the British Mandate of 1921. At first, Um Saad refuses to speak with a &#34;filthy Bedouin,&#34; but the two women gradually become friends, united in a fierce struggle to survive the inhuman rigors of the institution. The life stories they share with one another are simultaneously horrifying and mesmerizing. Maha&#39;s husband Harb, an heroic member of the Resistance, was the love of her life. After he is killed by the British, their love is not enough to protect her from the violence and repression that surround her. Um Saad yields, too, to the humiliation of her husband bringing home a new young wife. Faqir&#39;s masterful use of irony sets the tale&#39;s iconoclastic tone and relieves the characters&#39; relentless pain. In the opening pages, for example, her storyteller, Sami al-Adjnabi, interrupts his smarmy invocation to &#34;Allah the Beneficent&#34; - a disingenuous patter we assume he obsequiously utters before any oral presentation - to say, &#34;On second thoughts, it is my she-ass Aziza who should tell you this story. Faqir&#39;s story - most assured unlike any Sami has told ever before -about consequences endured by women who tell the truth is impossible to put down. --Independant Publisher</p><h2>By Sorrow&#39;s River: A Novel (Berrybender Narratives)</h2><p>In this tale of high-spirited and terrifying adventure, set against the background of the West that Larry McMurtry has made his own, <i>By Sorrow&#x2019;s River</i> is an epic in its own right, with an extraordinary young woman as its leading figure.<br><br>At the heart of this third volume of his Western saga remains the beautiful and determined Tasmin Berrybender, now married to the &#x201c;Sin Killer&#x201d; and mother to their young son, Monty. <i>By Sorrow&#x2019;s River</i> continues the Berrybender party&#x2019;s trail across the endless Great Plains of the West toward Santa Fe, where they intend, those who are lucky enough to survive the journey, to spend the winter. They meet up with a vast array of characters from the history of the West: Kit Carson, the famous scout; Le Partezon, the fearsome Sioux war chief; two aristocratic Frenchmen whose eccentric aim is to cross the Great Plains by hot air balloon; a party of slavers; a band of raiding Pawnee; and many other astonishing characters who prove, once again, that the rolling, grassy plains are not, in fact, nearly as empty of life as they look. Most of what is there is dangerous and hostile, even when faced with Tasmin&#x2019;s remarkable, frosty sangfroid. She is one of the strongest and most interesting of Larry McMurtry&#x2019;s women characters, and is at the center of this powerful and ambitious novel of the West.</p><p>Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays. He lives in Archer City, Texas.Molina reads in soft-spoken, comfortable tones that make the listener's experience relaxing, as well as entertaining. McMurtry continues his saga of Lord Berrybender and his four willful daughters, his haughty mistress, and their inept servants. As these characters meet up with real historical figures like Kit Carson, Charles Bent, and Pomp Charbonneau, the ironies, vanities, and tragedies of the West are revealed. Alfred Molina finds unique male and female voices for McMurtry's finely drawn cast. He precisely captures Tasmin Berrybender Snow's frosty temperament and her primitive frontiersman, Jim's, frustration and bewilderment.

As the United States witnesses a major shift in its population&#x2014;from a white majority to a country where no single group predominates&#x2014;the new mix not only affects relations between ethnic groups but also influences how individuals view themselves. This book addresses the development of individual and social identity within the context of these new demographic and cultural shifts. It identifies the contemporary forces that shape group identity in order to show how Chicana/os' sense of personal identity and social identity develops and how these identities are affected by changes in social relations. The authors, both nationally recognized experts in social psychology, are concerned with the subjective definitions individuals have about the social groups with which they identify, as well as with linguistic, cultural, and social contexts. Their analysis reveals what the majority of Chicanas/os experience, using examples from music, movies, and the arts to illustrate complex concepts. In considering �Qui�n Soy? ("Who Am I?"), they discuss how individuals develop a positive sense of who they are as Chicanas/os, with an emphasis on the influence of family, schools, and community. Regarding �Qui�nes Somos? ("Who Are We?"), they explore Chicanas/os' different group memberships that define who they are as a people, particularly reviewing the colonization history of the American Southwest to show how Chicanas/os' group identity is influenced by this history. A chapter on "Language, Culture, and Community" looks at how Chicanas/os define their social identities inside and outside their communities, whether in the classroom, neighborhood, or region. In a final chapter, the authors speculate how Chicana/o identity will change as Chicanas/os become a significant proportion of the U.S. population and as such factors as immigration, intermarriage, and improvements in social standing influence the process of identification. At the end of each chapter is an engaging exercise that reinforces its main argument and shows how psychological approaches are applicable to real life. <i>Chicana/o Identity in a Changing U.S. Society</i> is an unprecedented introduction to psychological issues that students can relate to and understand. It complements other titles in the Mexican American Experience series to provide a balanced view of issues that affect Mexican Americans today.</p><p>A�da Hurtado is Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and author of <i>Voicing Chicana Feminisms: Young Women Speak Out on Sexuality and Identity</i>.

Voyager</i>&nbsp;drew inspiration from a killer whale,&nbsp;a Starfleet runabout, and a sleek and&nbsp;curvy car. <br><br>The&nbsp;<i>U.S.S. Voyager&nbsp;</i>was always&nbsp;meant to hark back to Kirk&#x2019;s original&nbsp;<i>Enterprise</i>.&nbsp;Whereas the&nbsp;<i>Enterprise-D</i>&nbsp;had been designed to be a hotel in&nbsp;space with all the facilities of a&nbsp;university,&nbsp;<i>Voyager</i>&nbsp;was a small,&nbsp;maneuverable craft. &#x201c;It is a ship that&nbsp;was specifically designed for action,&#x201d;&nbsp;co-creator Jeri Taylor told&nbsp;<i>Cinefantastique</i>. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s smaller, it more&nbsp;maneuverable, it can land on a&nbsp;planet&#x2019;s surface, it can be sent into&nbsp;situations where a&nbsp;Galaxy-class starship&nbsp;simply can&#x2019;t function.&#x201d;<br><br>Design work began in the fall of 1993,&nbsp;as&nbsp;<i>STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION</i>&#x2019;s&nbsp;run on TV drew to a close. The project&nbsp;was headed up by&nbsp;TNG&#x2019;s production&nbsp;designer, with&nbsp;<i>Voyager</i>&#x2019;s&nbsp;design being&nbsp;led by concept artist Rick Sternbach.<br><br>Richard James knew that their&nbsp;starship would also need a new look,&nbsp;but, as he remembers, it couldn&#x2019;t be too&nbsp;new, &#x201c;Mr. Berman said, &#x2018;I want it to be&nbsp;different; I don&#x2019;t want it to look like&nbsp;<i>THE&nbsp;NEXT GENERATION</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>DEEP SPACE NINE</i>.&#x2019;&nbsp;But he also said that if people were&nbsp;flipping channels, then he wanted them&nbsp;to instantly recognize the fact that it&nbsp;was&nbsp;<i>STAR TREK</i>.&#x201d; <br>As Sternbach recalls, when he first&nbsp;started work on the ship he knew very&nbsp;little about it. The writer&#x2019;s bible&nbsp;described&nbsp;Voyager&nbsp;as having a&nbsp;&#x201c;streamlined, bullet sort of shape&#x201d; and&nbsp;he was told that&nbsp;the producers wanted&nbsp;the new design to be much smaller than&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Enterprise-D</i>.<br><br><b>FIRST THOUGHTS</b><br><br>As usual, he started by producing a&nbsp;series of rough sketches, looking for a&nbsp;basic shape. &#x201c;The early felt-pen&nbsp;sketches show a number of shapes&nbsp;drawn over and over, as I attempted to&nbsp;settle on a&nbsp;first best guess at the new&nbsp;ship. A streamlined, dart-like primary hull&nbsp;was matched to a flattened, elongated&nbsp;engineering hull, sporting swept-back&nbsp;runabout pylons.&#x201d;<br><br>In these days it was important that&nbsp;whatever Sternbach designed could&nbsp;actually be made as a physical model&nbsp;and as he recalls, he talked to the visual effects producer Dan Curry about&nbsp;any requirements his team might have. <br>&#x201c;Even in the first design phase, Dan&nbsp;Curry reminded me of the general rules&nbsp;of miniature design, such as making&nbsp;certain that motion control mount points&nbsp;were near the model&#x2019;s center of gravity,&nbsp;and that the belly mount be the&nbsp;absolute lowest part of the ship, in order&nbsp;to avoid problems with the bluescreen&nbsp;filming.&#x201d;<br><br>From those very first sketches&nbsp;Sternbach was moving away from Andy&nbsp;Probert&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Enterprise-D</i> with its &#x2018;fat&#x2019;&nbsp;saucer as he started to look for a&nbsp;more streamlined design. While he was&nbsp;working, the concept for&nbsp;<i>Voyager</i>&nbsp;continued to evolve as the executive&nbsp;producers continued to work on the&nbsp;bible. As a result, he would receive&nbsp;requests that changed the way he thought about the design. <br><br>&#x201c;Along the way, we were told the&nbsp;ship would be able to land on a&nbsp;planetary surface. This was a real&nbsp;departure from the norm,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;So&nbsp;deployable landing gear and other&nbsp;arrangements of resting on hull&nbsp;components were sketched out. The&nbsp;producers also wanted some part of the&nbsp;ship to animate or articulate either the&nbsp;nacelles, or a weapon array, or perhaps&nbsp;the&nbsp;navigational deflector.<br><br>&#x201c;Variations filled more paper as the&nbsp;proportions of different parts changed,&nbsp;pieces were added and subtracted, &nbsp;and hull contours, both gently curved&nbsp;and angular, were explored in&nbsp;perspective. Even in the rough sketches,&nbsp;a lot of design ideas got worked out,&nbsp;concerning placement of familiar items&nbsp;like&nbsp;impulse engines and phasers.&#x201d;</p><h2>Unfinished Business: Returning the Ministry to the People of God</h2><p><p>The Reformation restored the Scriptures to the people, but the job was only halfway finished. Today the church is awakening to the truth that ministry is not just the domain of clergy, but belongs to the entire body of Christ. God is moving her to complete her unfinished business of placing the ministry back in the hands of the people. Unfinished Business has played a pivotal part in helping the church reclaim ministry at the grassroots level. First published in 1990 as The New Reformation, it has become a classic resource for church life. Expanding on and updating the original material with fresh examples and references to eight key important movements, this new edition lays foundations for the church to move from: � Passive to active � Maintenance to mission � Clergy to people of God � Teacher/caregiver to equipping enabler Pointing us back to the church as an organism, not an institution, author Greg Ogden shows how each of us is called to help finish the Reformation&#x2019;s unfinished business: expressing the priesthood of every believer practically in the church, the world, and all avenues of life.</p></p><p><p>Greg Ogden (DMin, Fuller Theological Seminary) was the executive pastor of discipleship at Christ Church in Oak Brook, Illinois, and served previously as director of the Doctor of Ministry program at Fuller Theological Seminary.

Yet, says Margaret Bendroth, the past tense is essential to our language of faith, and without it our conversation is limited and thin.<br><br>This accessible, beautifully written book presents a new argument for honoring the past. The Christian tradition gives us the powerful image of a vast communion of saints, all of God's people, both living and dead, in vital conversation with each other. This kind of connection with our ancestors in the faith, Bendroth maintains, will not happen by wishing or by accident. She argues that remembering must become a regular spiritual practice, part of the rhythm of our daily lives as we recognize our world to be, in many ways, a gift from others who have gone before.</p><p>Margaret Lamberts Bendroth is executive director of theAmerican Congregational Association and director of theCongregational Library in Boston. Her other books includeWomen and Twentieth-Century Protestantism andFundamentalism and Gender.<b><i>Modern Believing</i></b><br> "A beautifully written book. . . . Offers a helpful invitation to a real and living engagement with our history - and those who lived it."<br><br><b>Grant Wacker</b><br> -- Duke Divinity School<br> "Margaret Bendroth shows once again that she is an artist who happens to work with words rather than paint or clay; she is also a Christian and a historian. Bendroth makes a powerful case that the past is never totally past but remains a rich resource for the practice of our faith. The point is less the mastery of this or that 'dry' detail than to see that our spiritual parents often faced questions similar to ours yet gave answers different from ours -- answers more practical, more creative, and more faithful. It pays to pay attention. The book is at once learned, thought-filled, and wonderfully engaging."<br><br><b>Nancy S. Taylor</b><br> -- Old South Church in Boston<br> "Abounding in colorful anecdotes -- and laced with wry and sympathetic humor -- this memory book reads like a good diary, a page-turning adventure through sacred history. Bendroth argues that meaningful remembering requires imagination and determination but is well worth the effort, for it cannot but form us into better Christians and finer human beings."<br><br><b><i>Christian Century</i></b><br> "Bendroth's book is perfect in size and scope for adult education classes. Participants might reflect on their religious heritage and how it has shaped their place in today's church. As she notes, remembering involves more than organizing anniversary celebrations, publishing yearbooks, and hanging pictures of the church choirs on the walls. Churches need congregants who will tell stories about the life of the church, music directors who will provide the context for the composition of beloved hymns, and ministers who will incorporate the congregation's messy and complex history into sermons. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For Bendroth, remembering means reorienting one's perspective so that the life of the congregation revolves as much around the past and the future as the present."&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>Presbyterian Outlook</i></b><br> "Margaret Bendroth has written a deeply thoughtful, but easily accessible, reflection on the various ways that different cultures relate to the past and those who inhabited it. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is not a polemical book, but one that could start a thousand conversations, and it is about time we had them."<br><br><b><i>Spirituality &amp; Practice</i></b><br> "Bendroth challenges Christians to begin a new conversation with the communion of saints who are spread across time and space. Here memory becomes not just an isolated act of an individual but a cooperative adventure uniting believers as they try to make sense of the past, present, and future."<br><br><b><i>Methodist Recorder</i>&nbsp;(UK)</b><br> "Margaret Bendroth's book is thought-provoking and inspiring.

Supersized life spans are going to radically alter society, and present an unprecedented opportunity to change our approach not only to old age but to all of life's stages. The ramifications are just beginning to dawn on us.... yet in the meantime, we keep thinking about, and planning for, life as it used to be lived.<p> In <i>A Long Bright Future</i>, longevity and aging expert Laura Carstensen guides us into the new possibilities offered by a longer life. She debunks the myths and misconceptions about aging that stop us from adequately preparing for the future both as individuals and as a society: that growing older is associated with loneliness and unhappiness, and that only the genetically blessed live well and long. She then focuses on other important components of a long life, including finances, health, social relationships, Medicare and Social Security, challenging our preconceived notions of old age&#x201d; every step of the way.</p></p><p><b>Laura L. Carstensen, Ph.D.</b> is a professor of psychology, and the founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity. Her research has been supported for more than twenty years by the National Institute on Aging. A Guggenheim Fellow, an NIH Merit Award winner and a member of the MacArthur Foundation's Research Network on an Aging Society, she lives in Los Altos Hills, California.Chapter 1<br><b>Five Myths About Aging You Can't Afford to Believe</b><br>&nbsp;<br>If we're going to develop a clear-eyed view of our futures, as a prelude to making old age better and longer-lasting, we're going to have to get rid of as many myths about aging as we can--and there are plenty. In fact, there is a very good chance that much of what you think you know about aging is wrong.<br>The entire aging process is fraught with unappealing stereotypes and discouraging myths, probably because few of us see aging up close until we're fully immersed in it ourselves. American society is so age segregated that the few older people we do know are usually our grandparents or elder relatives--a small and decidedly unrepresentative sample whose very status as close family often blurs the nuances of their personalities and their lives. We often appreciate just the roles they fill, not the people they are.<br>After all, how many of us have subtle and complex understandings of the older people in our families until we're older ourselves? I certainly didn't ask a lot of questions of my older relatives when I was young. I loved them, but didn't really try to get to know them as individuals. For their part, older relatives may not spend much time disclosing the details of their personal lives to the younger generation; a family's focus is usually on the young ones. Until my Aunt Mabel was in her nineties, I assumed she had been single all of her life. In fact, she had had a short and turbulent marriage when she was young woman. Until I was middle-aged, I didn't know her sister had been found dead in a hotel room, and I still don't know the circumstances that surrounded her death. I didn't know that my grandfather was the person in his small Nebraska town to whom everyone turned whenever they needed any sort of appliance or radio repaired. The man apparently had an instinct for electricity. Maybe it is no coincidence that his son, my father, grew up to study electromagnetic fields. But I didn't make these connections until I was aging myself.<br>In the absence of personal knowledge, we may expect all older people to be cut from the same cloth as the few we happen to know. I suspect that this is why aging stereotypes tend to run to one-dimensional polar opposites, either based on happy times at holidays with beloved older family members, or on negative interactions with people who seem extremely irritable or sick. Worse, when we imagine what we'll be like ourselves when we're older, we tend to extrapolate from our limited family experiences, and that's not always a pretty picture--it depends on whether your particular Aunt Betty baked cookies or had dementia. Time after time, I've given talks about aging and people in the audience tell me either that they believe a particular finding because their grandmothers are just like that, or they refuse to believe it, because their grandmothers aren't like that at all.<br>Few of us see the scope, the range, or the complexities of older lives. For purely selfish reasons, this is problematic because it makes it hard to know where we're headed ourselves, and to consider the vast range of possibilities ahead. The truth of it is that older people's life paths are anything but binary; there's a good deal of shading between saintly granny and sour grump. Their lives are also anything but bland. In fact, in terms of personality and life experience, older people are the most diverse part of the population. My dad likes to say that all babies are alike--as infants, they have little opportunity to differentiate. But with every decade of life, every twist in the life path makes people more individual, less likely to have been shaped by the exact same set of experiences as anyone else. Consequently, as a person grows older, chronological age tells us less and less about what they will be like. It makes no sense to embark on discussions about aging societies by reducing older populations to their lowest common denominators.<br>As a practical matter for people who want to plan happy, healthy long lives for themselves, or for a society that wants to engineer them for everyone, these myths don't just seed doubts, they are impediments to change. They create worries that cloud the imagination and blunt hope, even if they never pan out. They create social stresses and divisions between generations that don't really need to exist. They promote anachronistic expectations about old age that, as a species and a society, we have simply outgrown, and that are out of step with the way real people live today. Much of the time, they paint such a grim picture of the future that we dread thinking about it, never mind planning for it!<br>Let's start by getting rid of five of the worst myths:<br>* The "Misery Myth" that older people are sad and lonely<br>* The "DNA Is Destiny Myth" that your whole fate is foretold in your genes<br>* The "Work Hard, Retire Harder Myth" that we should rush to exit the workforce<br>* The "Scarcity Myth" that older people are a drain on the world's resources<br>* The "We Age Alone Myth" that how we fare in old age is entirely an individual matter, and not a function of society<br>Myth #1: Older People Are Miserable<br>The biggest myth on the menu is that older people are inevitably unhappy, lonely, and dejected. If you've been dreading the passage of time because you worry that your happiest days are behind you, take heart. I've spent the last thirty years investigating the psychology of aging, and my research consistently shows that, in terms of emotion, the best years come late in life.<br>With the exception of dementia-related diseases, which by definition have organic roots, mental health generally improves with age. Older people as a group suffer less from depression, anxiety, and substance abuse than their younger counterparts. In everyday life, they experience fewer negative emotions than people in their twenties and thirties--the people we stereotypically think of as the most happy--yet just as many positive ones. Moreover, older people manage negative emotions better than younger people do. When negative feelings arise, they don't linger the way they do in the young. Many people, even social scientists, are shocked by these findings. They challenge our implicit understanding of happiness, which is that it flows from the esoteric qualities of youth: health, beauty, power. But if these naturally recede with age, why are older people so content?<br>This has been dubbed the paradox of aging, but I maintain there is more logic than paradox. The answer lies in something we might commonly call life perspective; a more technical term that I and my colleagues have introduced is "socioemotional selectivity." I'll discuss our theory about this concept in greater depth in chapter 4, but the crux of this idea is that human beings are unique in their ability to measure the passage of time against a sort of internal "life span clock," keeping track of where they are in the life cycle. When we are young, time seems expansive, and we focus on acquiring knowledge, seeking novel experiences, and enmeshing ourselves in a large network of friends and colleagues. As we age, we sense the clock winding down and our attention shifts to savoring the time that is left, focusing instead on depth of experience, closeness, a smaller set of goals, and a highly selected group of loved ones.<br>This change in perspective seems to bring with it a new way of evaluating what is worth one's time, attention, worry, or wrath. For many, this translates into a greater tendency to let go of life's negatives, and to focus on the positives. My mother managed to nail this perspective with a single sentence in an e-mail she sent me last week: "Still having terrible winter weather, but isn't that full moon beautiful?"<br>For most older people, simple pleasures expand in importance. Sticky interpersonal situations don't seem worth the trouble. Good times are cherished, and there is greater recognition that bad times will pass. People are more likely to forgive when time horizons are limited. Even the very experience of emotion changes with age; feelings grow richer and more complex.<br>Indeed, social circles shrink over the years, but it's not an indicator of loneliness. Usually this shedding of connections is felt as a beneficial change, as people distill their social roster to their most valued friends, weeding out the coworkers and casual acquaintances who took up so much time and effort before. Older people report being more satisfied with their social relationships than younger people do, particularly prizing their relationships with their children and other younger relatives.<br>Marriages deepen, too, starting around the time that the last of the couple's children leaves the nest; in fact, many couples reach honeymoon levels of satisfaction when the kids move out. One of my favorite findings about long-term marriages is that even unhappily married couples report that, after many years together, they are happier than they used to be. It's actually the relatively early years of marriage, particularly the points at which the kids are either toddlers or adolescents, that take the biggest toll on marital contentment.<br>Mind you, it's not that young and middle-aged married couples don't enjoy parenting or love their children--they do. Rather, children tend to produce tensions between mothers and fathers. Young parents suddenly have less time for enjoyable activities with each other and find themselves in frequent conflicts over how to care for the baby. Even in homes where the parents strive to be egalitarian, a more gendered division of labor arises. Fathers may feel left out of the close bond that forms almost instantly between mother and child, and feel pressured to work increasingly hard outside of the home to provide for the new family. Stay-at-home mothers often feel burdened and left out of the world.<br>Once the children are grown and launched from the home, couples reconnect. I try not to smile when the college students I teach at Stanford express concern about h...</p><h2>Fat Pig: A Play</h2><p><p>Cow. Slob. Pig.

Which is what he loved to do, preaching often and writing in the course of his lifetime no fewer than eighty-five works of philosophy and theology books that changed the Church and the world. Indeed, in 1320, less than fifty years after Thomas died, Thomas's biographer said that "throughout the entire world Thomas's teachings have spread among the faithful, and the whole Church is instructed by his voice." </p><p> Today, the Church Herself calls Saint Thomas Aquinas the Angelic Doctor ("the teacher who is like an angel"): pure, strong, close to God, and truly a messenger of divine light.</p><p> Scholar he was, but to those who knew him, Saint Thomas gave not only beautiful sermons and books, but also his heart, his devotion, and his love.

Textbooks tell us that it came about as a result of a rediscovery of the ideas and ideals of classical Greece and Rome. But now bestselling historian Gavin Menzies makes the startling argument that in the year 1434, China&#x2014;then the world's most technologically advanced civilization&#x2014;provided the spark that set the European Renaissance ablaze. From that date onward, Europeans embraced Chinese ideas, discoveries, and inventions, all of which form the basis of Western civilization today.</p><p>The <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>1421</em> combines a long-overdue historical reexamination with the excitement of an investigative adventure, bringing the reader aboard the remarkable Chinese fleet as it sails from China to Cairo and Florence, and then back across the world. Erudite and brilliantly reasoned, <em>1434</em> will change the way we see ourselves, our history, and our world.</p></p><p><p>Gavin Menzies is the bestselling author of <em>1421: The Year China Discovered America</em>; <em>1434: The Year a Magnificent Chinese Fleet Sailed to Italy and Ignited the Renaissance</em>; and <em>The Lost Empire of Atlantis: History's Greatest Mystery Revealed</em>. He served in the Royal Navy between 1953 and 1970. His knowledge of seafaring and navigation sparked his interest in the epic voyages of Chinese admiral Zheng He. Menzies lives in London.</p>In Menzies's 1421, the amateur historian advanced a highly controversial hypothesis, that the Chinese discovered America; in this follow-up, he credits the Renaissance not to classical Greek and Roman ideals (a "Eurocentric view of history") but again to the Chinese. His thesis in both works is based on the seven (historically undisputed) voyages undertaken by a large Chinese sailing fleet between 1405 and 1433; while it is known that they traveled as far as east Africa, Menzies believes that they landed in Italy and sent a delegation to the Council of Venice, held in Florence in 1439. There, they provided the knowledge and technique-introducing the painter Alberti, for instance, to the methods of perspective drawing-that sparked the Renaissance. Menzies sets the stage by recapitulating arguments from his first book, including the ingenious method for calculating longitude that Chinese navigators may have used. Though Menzies writes engagingly, his assumption that the Chinese fleet landed a delegation in Florence is highly speculative, and hardly substantiated by any facts (Alberti could just have easily learned perspective from classical sources; the Greeks knew about the relationship between perception of length and distance in the 1st Century BCE). <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She often wrote about the margins of society, and about subjects considered untouchable. her prize-winning fiction is remarkable for its psychological acuity, its unflinching examination of erotic themes and gender relations, and its technical virtuosity. Mirroring the dislocation of mostly women protagonists, her stories move between present and past, Old World and New, dream and reality.<br><br>While many of her stories opened a window on the Old World and the Holocaust, she also wrote about the margins of society, about subjects considered untouchable, among them abortion, prostitution, women's erotic imaginings, and even incest.

This was in the 1930s, and Yamsi was one of the last great cattle ranches of the West. Soon the boy, nicknamed Hawk,&#x201d; was riding a horse, soaking up ranch life from the hired hands, and winning the cowboys&#x2019; respect.<br><br>A natural bronco buster, he eventually became a rodeo rider, bull fighter, clown, and photographer, working all over the West with the likes of Slim Pickens, Rex Allen, and Mel Lambert all of whom went on to careers in Hollywood and selling pictures to <i>Life</i> magazine. After the Second World War, he took over the reins at Yamsi, ensuring its survival in changing times. Now, half a century later, he gives us his valedictory ode to that last great period of the Old West. Full of humor, rollicking stories, and love of the land, Hyde pays homage to the cowboys, Indians, and great horses that made the West the legend it is today.</p><p><strong>Dayton O.&nbsp;Hyde</strong> is a rancher, photographer, self-taught naturalist, and essayist. The author of fifteen books, including the classic <em>Don Coyote</em>, he has won awards for his writing and conservation work. He founded the Black Hills Wild Horse Sanctuary in South Dakota, where he now lives.Starred Review. At 13, Hyde ran away from home, hopping a train from Wisconsin to his uncle's ranch in Oregon. Like countless other American kids in the 1930s, he wanted to be a cowboy. Hyde became that, and much more: rodeo clown, <i>Life</i> photographer, WWII soldier, author, historian and driving force behind the campaign to save the country's few remaining herds of wild horses. It's a dramatic life story, and Hyde has a raconteur's gift for telling it well. He vividly describes his initiations into the trade of cowboy, enduring the ridicule of grizzled ranch hands with little patience for a gangly teenager. Hyde earns their respect by risking his life to herd cattle through a blizzard; he earns some more by breaking horses no one else is able to tame. After he fights the Nazis, he organizes a rodeo inside a Roman coliseum in liberated France. His adventures over the years are populated with a colorful collection of friends. Some are towering figures who embody the Old West, like the septuagenarian cowboy who thinks nothing of tracking, capturing and taming a wild mustang in a single afternoon. Others seem like characters from a saloon act, like the two drunks who, attempting to dig a grave with dynamite, accidentally blast the surrounding coffins above ground. One especially captivating personality is rodeo clown Slim Pickens, whose lopsided grin would eventually enliven films like <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> and <i>Blazing Saddles</i>. Hyde mourns these figures' passing along with the West he loved. As wistful as it is humorous, this salty memoir is also an elegy for a bygone era.

The New Keynesian framework is the workhorse for the analysis of monetary policy and its implications for inflation, economic fluctuations, and welfare. A backbone of the new generation of medium-scale models under development at major central banks and international policy institutions, the framework provides the theoretical underpinnings for the price stability&#x2013;oriented strategies adopted by most central banks in the industrialized world.</p><p>Using a canonical version of the New Keynesian model as a reference, Jordi Gal� explores various issues pertaining to monetary policy's design, including optimal monetary policy and the desirability of simple policy rules. He analyzes several extensions of the baseline model, allowing for cost-push shocks, nominal wage rigidities, and open economy factors. In each case, the effects on monetary policy are addressed, with emphasis on the desirability of inflation-targeting policies. New material includes the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and an analysis of unemployment&#x2019;s significance for monetary policy.<br></p><ul><li>The most up-to-date introduction to the New Keynesian framework available </li><li>A single benchmark model used throughout </li><li>New materials and exercises included</li><li>An ideal resource for graduate students, researchers, and market analysts </li></ul><p></p></p><p><p>Praise for the previous edition: "Jordi Gal� provides an authoritative overview of the research that revolutionized monetary economics during the past decade, by embedding sticky prices in a coherent dynamic general equilibrium framework--thus providing a novel and much clearer positive and normative analysis of monetary policy. The presentation is elegant and intuitive, yet rigorous. The book will be a standard reference for graduate students, researchers, and policymakers. It is also highly recommended as a textbook for money/macro courses. Numerous useful exercises are provided."<b>--Robert Kollmann, European Center for Advanced Research in Economics and Statistics, Free University of Brussels</b></p><p>Praise for the previous edition: "A state-of-the-art treatment of the emerging New Keynesian synthesis by one of the leaders in the field, Gal�'s book is a must-read for the next generation of macroeconomists."<b>--N. Gregory Mankiw, Harvard University</b></p><p>Praise for the previous edition: "This is a wonderfully elegant and accessible introduction to the contemporary New Keynesian paradigm, written by one of the leading experts in the field. This monograph presents what one should know in a clean, cogent, and concise manner. I fully expect it to become a standard reference for both students and researchers in the field."<b>--Mark Gertler, New York University</b></p><p>Praise for the previous edition: "This book provides an excellent introduction and exegesis of the New Keynesian model that is the current state of the art in the analysis of monetary policy.

This book will be very useful to graduate students and to others seeking an introduction to modern work in this area."<b>--Michael Woodford, Columbia University</b></p><p>"This excellent book has already become a classic reference for economists who want to study the basic New Keynesian model. This update contains important extensions such as the impact of the zero lower bound on interest rates and an explicit treatment of unemployment.

When should we use our intuition and when should we rely on logic and statistics? Most of us would probably agree that for important decisions, we should follow certain guidelines&#x2015;gather as much information as possible, compare the options, pin down the goals before getting started. But in practice we make some of our best decisions by adapting to circumstances rather than blindly following procedures. In <i>Streetlights and Shadows</i>, Gary Klein debunks the conventional wisdom about how to make decisions. He takes ten commonly accepted claims about decision making and shows that they are better suited for the laboratory than for life. The standard advice works well when everything is clear, but the tough decisions involve shadowy conditions of complexity and ambiguity. Gathering masses of information, for example, works if the information is accurate and complete&#x2015;but that doesn't often happen in the real world. (Think about the careful risk calculations that led to the downfall of the Wall Street investment houses.) Klein offers more realistic ideas about how to make decisions in real-life settings. He provides many examples&#x2015;ranging from airline pilots and weather forecasters to sports announcers and Captain Jack Aubrey in Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander novels&#x2015;to make his point. All these decision makers saw things that others didn't. They used their expertise to pick up cues and to discern patterns and trends. We can make better decisions, Klein tells us, if we are prepared for complexity and ambiguity and if we will stop expecting the data to tell us everything.</p></p><p>Gary Klein is Senior Scientist at MacroCognition LLC.

To his credit, he does not claim that analytic decision models are useless. He argues that they are limited, and he shows how and why. Klein shows the importance of human understanding and experience as alternatives to analytic models, especially in complex and dynamic situations.

In tracing their experiences, a broader understanding of the connection between mestizaje (Latin America's modern ideology of racial mixture) and the colonial caste system is rendered. Before mestizaje emerged as a primary concept in Latin America, an earlier precursor existed that must be taken seriously. This colonial form of racial hybridity, encased in an elastic caste system, allowed some people to live through multiple racial lives.&nbsp;Hence, the great fusion of races that swept Latin America and defined its modernity, carries an important corollary.&nbsp;Mestizaje, when viewed at its roots, is not just about mixture, but also about dissecting and reconnecting lives.&nbsp; Such experiences may have carved a special ability for some Latin American populations to reach across racial groups to relate with and understand multiple racial perspectives.&nbsp;This overlooked, deep history of mestizaje is a legacy that can be built upon in modern times.</p><p>Using the case of Mexico, this book examines how the concept of caste evolved by studying the most extreme racial mixtures in society. By arguing that the experiences of these individuals laid important foundations for the future, this book will be of interest to readers studying race, race relations, caste, racial mixture, mestizaje, Mexico, and colonial Latin America.Ben Vinson, III is the Dean of Arts and Sciences at the George Washington University, Washington, DC.

It is his first comprehensive statement of phenomenological thought and research in over a decade. Phenomenology of practice refers to the meaning and practice of phenomenology in professional contexts such as psychology, education, and health care, as well as to the practice of phenomenological methods in contexts of everyday living. Van Manen presents a detailed description of key phenomenological ideas as they have evolved over the past century; he then thoughtfully works through the methodological issues of phenomenological reflection, empirical methods, and writing that a phenomenology of practice offers to the researcher. Van Manen&#x2019;s comprehensive work will be of great interest to all concerned with the interrelationship between being and acting in human sciences research and in everyday life.</p> <p>Max van Manen is the editor of the series <em>Phenomenology of Practice,</em> https://www.routledge.com/series/PPVM</p></p><p>Max van Manen is emeritus Professor in Research Methods, Pedagogy and Curriculum Studies in the Faculty of Education at the University of Alberta and Adjunct Professor at the University of Victoria.

He has also authored over 100 articles and chapters on pedagogy, health science, qualitative research methods, and phenomenology. He founded the journal Phenomenology and Pedagogy and developed the website PhenomenologyOnline. He was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Curriculum Division of the American Educational Research Association among numerous other awards and distinctions."Dr. Max van Manen is a giant among contemporary phenomenologists and his work continues to inspire. Max's new book is very comprehensive, so comprehensive that it tells the story of the history of what it means to be human and "in the world." The book provides not only the traditional foundations of phenomenology in terms of philosophy/ies and method/s, but also, challenging us to reflect and dialogue about new thoughts or ideas that we may not have thought about. Max's use of etymology is so profound. One can put themselves in his stories and explanations of the lifeworld and "see" meaning at a very deep level. I highly recommend this book to faculty and students who are in search of a scholarly approach to philosophy and method in phenomenology. But I also recommend this book for all those who are in search of a fuller understanding of the meaning of meaning. "<br> &#x2015;Marilyn A.

In the midst of the greatest global mobility ever, Ting-Toomey and Dorjee have seized this moment to weave together intercultural knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors to develop powerful bridges across troubled waters. Expanding on Ting-Toomey&#x2019;s first edition, the second edition eloquently synthesizes different contexts, disciplines, and perspectives. The book's examination of mindfulness and identity negotiation encompasses both domestic and international complexities. New discussions of mobility, adjustment and acculturation, and social identity theory are fresh and relevant.

It examines core intercultural communication variables--identity, competence, values, culture shock, language, and nonverbal communication--before turning to important issues and settings such as immigration, intergroup biases, conflict, intimate relationships, and ethics. I am particularly pleased to see attention given to peace building and social justice issues in the second edition.

Could this be because we have underestimated their spiritual potential, and been content to feed them a repetitive spiritual diet of basic Bible stories over and over again?

In their earliest childhood Hungarian children hear the story of "Forgetme-Not" (Nfelejts), the history of the "Twin Hunchbacks" (A Ret Torpe), and the doings of the wicked Sultana in the "Magic Cat" (A Buvos Macska.) In my little book is the shell of these stories told simply and in few words. Who was the originator of them? I do not think any one knows, for I have found in many instances the same incidents occurring in the fairy tales of most nations. A modified form of the vain fairy Narcissa is revived in "Little Snow White," and "Riquet with the Tuft" has, if I mistake not, an incident similar to that in "The Twin Hunchbacks." But then again, who has ever traced the origin of all the proverbs and jokes that exist, and have existed for generations, in two score or more Eastern and Western, Latin, Teutonic, or Slavonic languages? Old Hungarian legends, just like old Hungarian music, have to the national mind no palpable origin, though Jokay or Gaal have rewritten the former and Liszt or Brahms have familiarized the world with the latter. The following little collection has helped me in my childhood to pass many pleasant hours, so I now give them to my little English readers&#x2014;embellished by many drawings&#x2014;in the hope that they may derive as much pleasure from this little volume of magic and adventure as I did from my old torn copy of "Nepmesek." ("Uletka a kilencz torpteknel.") IN a certain country there dwelt a prince whose name was Elkabo. He had a dear little daughter called Uletka, who was a most sweet child. She and her father lived quite alone in an old castle with four towers, that stood in a beautiful glade in the centre of a great forest..</p><p></p><h2>Awesome Good Clean Jokes for Kids</h2><p><p>Bob Phillips&#x2019; original GOOD CLEAN JOKES FOR KIDS was such a hit that the master jokester has scoured the earth (well, not quite) for even more crazy riddles, puns, knock-knocks, wisecracks, and tongue twisters.

It is primarily based on historical facts from sources such as Church Records, Tax Registers, Land Surveyor Notes, General Muster Rolls, and Estate Inventories, but also, to some extent, on tales handed down within the family.<br><br> In the 16th century, Sweden had broken away from the Roman Catholic Church to become a Lutheran country. After a successful war against the Catholic countries in central Europe in the early 17th century, the Swedish King and the Church of Sweden cooperated in taking stricter control over the population. Such was the situation at the beginning of this book, which illustrates, with a series of examples, how the decisions of the political and religious leaders befell the simple people on the bottom of society.<br><br> During the reoccurring wars in the 18th century, soldiers were sent to fight in other countries. Many of them never returned. What happened to their wives and children? The rules of the Church allowed only true Lutherans to share the Holy Communion and to get married. What happened to those who did not pass the compulsory hearings? The difference between social classes was vast. How did a young woman who had grown up in a one-room cottage with a naked earth floor react, when she came to work as a maid in a mansion with parquet flooring and walls covered with French wallpaper? When the last war was over, in 1814, the rural population grew steadily, and ever more provincials sought refuge in the cities. What was life like in the overcrowded, urban, working-class areas? In the late 19th century, democracy and equality gradually developed within the Swedish society. What could an industrious man, starting out with two empty hands, achieve in this situation?<br><br>The purpose of this book is not only to present the history of Sweden from the perspective of the poor. It also intends to inspire and guide readers who would like to find out more about their own Swedish ancestors. The detailed accounts are based on facts found in historical documents, which next to all are available over the Internet. Over 400 reference notes at the end of the book indicate where to look for information. There is also a supplement discussing the quality and availability of the different sources.</p><p></p><h2>Anarchy: (Aziloth Books)</h2><p><p>Errico Malatesta was an Italian anarchist and writer (1853-1932), who lived much of his life in exile and was expelled or forced to flee from many of the countries he visited. He teamed up with other well known anarchists, like Peter Kropotkin and Mikhail Bakunin, to promote anarchist ideas and advocate revolution &#x2013; activities that resulted in more than ten years in prison.</p><p><em>Anarchy</em> was originally published in 1891 as a pamphlet. From the start, Malatesta is at pains to clarify the true meaning of the term. It should on no account, he says, be associated with disorder and chaos. Instead, it should be construed in its original Greek sense to mean &#x2018;without a ruler&#x2019; or &#x201c;... without any constituted authority ... or government.&#x201d;</p><p>This short treatise outlines Anarchy&#x2019;s tenets, among which are the abolition of private property, privilege and class and the formation of decentralized self-governing communities. In Malatesta&#x2019;s view, people have too long been conditioned into believing they need authoritarian government which, time and again, ends up serving a privileged few rather than the many. He urges us to reassert our natural inclination for voluntary cooperation and the sharing of skills and resources. Only then will we know true personal freedom.</p></p><p>Errico Malatesta was an Italian anarchist and writer (1853-1932), who lived much of his life in exile and was expelled or forced to flee from many of the countries he visited.

Aiming to have the perfect marriage is my mission, it's my quest; it's my Mt Everest. And yes, I'm fully aware of how great a masterpiece I am attempting to paint.</p> <p>Where others aim to become the world's fastest human or the next American Idol, my ambition is a bit misunderstood by the mainstream mentality. I know great marriage doesn't come cheap -- I know how much such a lofty ambition will cost me. It will take my pride and flush it down the toilet; it will tax every millimeter of my soul and ruthlessly expose my every selfish tendency; it will renovate my entire existence. </p> <p>And I say, "bring it on!"</p> <p>Great marriage is like an Olympic event. To compete at a world-class level in the arena of love demands extreme dedication, the focus of your entire being, and a staggering expenditure of heart, mind, and body. Marriage is certainly not life under a shade tree -- it's an emotional, physical, and psychological obstacle course in which only the fortified survive. Great marriages are the stuff of the heartiest and stoutest souls. Marriage inevitably weeds out the serious lovers from the casual holiday-ers seeking a short-term thrill and a few wedding gifts. Marriage is boot camp for the soul, the testing of the fiber of the heart, and the proving ground for the true substance of one's love. </p> <p>And I say, "bring it on!"</p> <p>Great marriages aren't stumbled upon, they are fought for. And if you achieve this impossible goal, there is no gold medal awaiting you on a podium in the end, no screaming crowd to applaud your many efforts, and no Wheaties box photo op to authenticate your sacrifice for posterity. No one outside of your God, your spouse, and your children may ever know what you have achieved. </p> <p>And I say, "bring it on!"</p> <p>Great marriage garners a much greater reward than mere human accolades. It wins the applause of heaven, the utter delight and total affection of your spouse for a lifetime, the purest and most perfect intimate pleasure a human can possibly know, and as a final bonus -- the lifelong admiration and respect of your children. A great marriage may cost you everything, but it also will unlock your heart to know the depths of God Almighty. In short, a great marriage gives back ten thousand times more than it takes. </p> <p>So I say, "bring it on!"</p> <p>~~</p> <p>What did you wake up this morning desiring to pursue? A cup of Starbucks? A few more hours sleep? An available bathroom? In the first ninety days of your new life together as a couple, you have an opportunity to establish a larger vision for your life as newly-weds. You too can share in my wake up routine, desiring to make <em>your </em>marriage into the world's very best. In fact, it's my desire that you will enter into a little bit of healthy competition with me and say, "Eric, your love story with Leslie is not even going to compare to mine!" As Paul encouraged the Romans, "Outdo one another in showing honor (Rom 12:10b). (1) I want you to look at my desire as a threat. I want your competitive juices to flow and I want your heart to burn with a clear sense of purpose. I want you to give me a run for my money! I want you to try and "outdo" me. After all, what's the challenge in it if no one else tries? Imagine God saying to me, "Well, Eric, you're the only one who even attempted, so I guess you are the champion." That's no fun! When I was eleven I won a huge trophy at a piano competition, but it was because I was the only contestant. Believe me, there's no satisfaction in winning that way! </p> <p>What sort of marriage are you going to aim for? A miserable one? A mediocre one? Or a marvelous one? Should I consider you serious competition, or just another marriage license signee?</p> <p>This book is about having a marvelous marriage; a marriage that sparkles, a marriage that will go the distance without ever losing its luster, a marriage that makes Hollywood's rendition of romance look forlorn and in need of a make-over. This book is written for those who are willing to do whatever it takes to scale the Everest of married love. This book is for those willing to wake up every morning and compete with me and Leslie for the world championship of lifelong romance. </p> <p>If you are in, then you need to be <em>all</em> in. Olympians train six to eight hours a day to gain mastery of their craft. What are you willing to give to gain mastery in marriage? Are you willing to put in the time, the effort, and the passion necessary to do it right? If you only want to offer your spouse a peck on the cheek as you leave for work each morning and roses once a year on Valentine's Day, this book isn't for you. But if you want to train like a champion, taste the mind-boggling ecstasy of marriage intimacy, and share in the most perfect satisfaction this side of heaven, then read on.</p> <p><strong> Superhero Secrets</strong></p> <p>Since I was a little tike I've wanted to have big muscles. But no matter how hard I've tried, it just hasn't worked out for me. I seem to have a body that refuses to look cool. As a result of this muscle fetish, you can probably understand why my childhood heroes were Samson, Superman, Arnold Schwarzennegar, the Bionic Man, and Popeye the Sailor-man. But I realized as I grew older that each one of these men had a secret to their strength that made it difficult, if not impossible, for me to imitate. Samson had the Nazarite vow and the long hair thing going, Superman was from another planet, Arnold worked out with weights six hours a day, the Bionic Man had to have six million dollars worth of work surgically done on him, and of course, Popeye had to eat spinach. Why couldn't superheroes just eat Pop Tarts, wear Levis, and listen to Bon Jovi? Why did they have to be so extreme, so different? Why did their secret have to be something so difficult to apply in my own life?</p> <p>As humans, it's tempting to seek the easy way to the top. We want to make our millions in the lottery, build our muscles with steroids, find instant fame through a reality show, and become well-read with Cliff's notes. Most of us don't want to travel the real road to success -- the one that involves hard work and making sacrifices. Not many of us are willing to take a Nazarite vow and look like a fool to this world around us, live life as if we are from another planet, spend the juiciest hours of everyday in training, yield ourselves to God's operating knife, and worst of all, swallow our spinach to gain superhuman strength. But such is the map to real marriage success. </p> <p>Are you willing to take your spinach? If so, I'd like to introduce you to the two secrets of all great spouses. I assure you they won't seem very appealing on the outside; superhero secrets never do. But if you are willing to take a Nazarite-like vow and go under God's surgical knife, you too could become the next superhero spouse.</p> <p><strong> Superhero Secret #1 <br> </strong><strong>Going under God's Surgical Knife</strong></p> <p><em> "Superhero spouses are those who learn to love out of a heavenly implanted heart."</em></p> <p> The other day I had a conversation with a young married man at the local coffee shop. We'll call him Barry. Like many other young men his age, Barry is an aficionado of marriage mediocrity. </p> <p>"It's nag, nag, nag!" He said a little louder than was socially appropriate for conversation in a public place. His lip snarled in disgust as he took a long sip from his Carmel Macchiato. "My wife wants me to be something I'm just not!"</p> <p>I let Barry rage on for several minutes, providing me with a few more quotations for this book. "I just tell her, look babe, you need to stop trying to make our marriage into a fairy tale -- that just isn't reality." My favorite was Barry's description of what really makes a marriage work. "When she finally gives up trying to turn me into her personal Prince Charming, then we might just get somewhere!"</p> <p> When Barry finally awakened to the fact that he'd been talking for five minutes straight without even asking me question, he turned the conversation in my direction.</p> <p>"So, man, what type of work do you do? </p> <p>"Oh, I'm a writer."</p> <p>"That's cool, man!" he said. "What do you write about?"</p> <p>"Romance and relationships."</p> <p>After that, Barry began shuffling around awkwardly and quickly changed the subject to the poor job the electrician did in installing the electrical outlet on the coffee shop wall. </p> <p>It's fairly obvious that Barry is no superhero spouse. But then, let's be honest, none of us are. The problem with Barry isn't found in the fact that he is not a Prince Charming, it's the fact that he doesn't believe he can ever even become one. He lacks both vision and willingness. He's bought into the "I'm a guy and this is the way I'm always gonna be!" syndrome. That syndrome spells the end of every potential superhero husband. And the problem doesn't just lie with guys. Women frequently buy into a similar mindset, sabotaging their ability to become superhero wives. </p> <p>The ability to love well, unfortunately, doesn't come naturally to any one. But there are two ways of looking at the "Barry" tendency in all of us. One is to say, "This is just the way I am, so learn to live with it, babe!" But the second option, though odd and uncomfortable, breeds superhuman results. It simply says, "I don't have what it takes in and of myself to be a great spouse. I need something more! And babe, because I love you so much, I'll go under the operating knife to get it!"</p> <p>Imagine how Popeye must have felt when he heard that his great strength could only be gained through endless jars of spinach. You may very well feel an...</p></p><h2>Amazing Grace for the Catholic Heart: 101 Stories of Faith, Hope, Inspiration &amp; Humor</h2><p><p>Amazing Grace for the Catholic Heart will help you celebrate your Catholic faith and will take you on a refreshing spiritual retreat away from the challenges and struggles of everyday life.

Along the way, you will meet old friends and enemies alike. Rare volumes will be opened to your eyes. Sacred holy books in which you may read the secrets of the Gods themselves and of their prophets. Scholarly histories of the rise and fall of empires from the Imperial Library at Tol Honeth. The profound mysteries of the Malloreon Gospels. THE RIVAN CODEX will enrich your understanding of all that has gone before . . . and whet your appetite for more spectacular adventures from this talented team.</p><p>So you want to write a multivolume, bestselling epic fantasy? Here's the book to help you. <i>The Rivan Codex</i> was published to answer the many letters David and Leigh Eddings have received from students, teachers, and aspiring writers. It's a companion to the 12-book fantasy series comprised of The Belgariad (five books), The Malloreon (five books), <i>Belgarath the Sorcerer</i> and <i>Polgara the Sorceress</i>. In David Eddings's words, <i>The Rivan Codex</i> "may give the student of our genre some insights into the creative process--something on the order of 'connect wire A to wire B. Warning! Do not connect wire A to wire C, because that will cause the whole thing to blow up in your face." This is a collection of the groundwork David and Leigh Eddings laid for the Belgariad and Malloreon series. On this firm foundation they imagined and built their world in book after book. <p> There's a fascinating introduction, a personal history of Belgarath the sorcerer, Holy Books, Gospels, Histories, King Anheg's diary, and an afterword. Footnotes tell how the authors used and changed these materials in writing the books. And of course, there are plenty of maps (the starting point for all epic fantasies). <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><br>Truth to tell, I'd give anything for a new Eddings novel, a new world where David and Leigh can work the magic they did with The Belgariad and The Malloreon, The Elenium and The Tamuli. There's nothing like an Eddings adventure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while the Eddings are busy inventing a new world and peopling it with heroes and vallains and just-plain-folks (skulking and otherwise), it's nice to peek behind the scenes and see what went into inventing the world of The Belgariad. It helps you appreciate why it does take so long to start a truly new series. And, as one of the first people to see the rough material of this book said--how did she put it?--it's actually very giving of Dave to share this much of the creative process with his readers. And as impatient as we all are for a new adventure, I think we've got time to sit and reminisce with old friends...<br><p>--Veronica Chapman, Senior Editor</p></p><h2>Did The Catholic Church Give Us The Bible?</h2><p>The True History of God's Words<br><br>There is not one history of the Bible, but two. One is a history of God preserving His words through His people. The other is of the devil using the Roman Catholic church to pervert God's words through her "scholars."<br><br>Written in a down-to-earth style, and packed with cartoon illustrations by Jack Chick, Daniels shows that the Bibles Rome gave us are really clever counterfeits, designed to eliminate God's preserved words in English, the KJV. You will see why the KJV is the only Bible you can trust.</p><p>David Daniels, B.A., M.Div., is trained in Bible and linguistics. After twenty years of searching the Hebrew and Greek scriptures and studying the history of the Bible, he has concluded that the King James Bible is God&#39;s preserved words in English.It took 300 years of clever maneuvering to bring us where we are today. David Daniels masterfully uncovers facts blurred by Roman Catholic historians. This marvelous book will be a wild ride and an eye opener. History, that so many find difficult to understand, is made simple with down-to-earth explanations backed by many illustrations. The Roman Catholic system did NOT give us the Bible, as they so blatantly claim. --Jack Chick</p><h2>Sunshine on My Shoulders (with Audio CD and Musical Score)</h2><p>This exuberant adaptation of the famous song by John Denver is sure to make you smile, even on a dark and cuddly evening with your child.

"John's songs gave me hope, joy, and an unbounded belief in possibilities," he says. "<i>Sunshine On My Shoulders</i> is a beautiful, moving song of giving, sharing and appreciation.

Isabel lifted up the front layers of the white dress and carefully clipped them to the portable clothesline in the back room of the boutique. With a dress like this&#x2014;multiple layers of flowing chiffon&#x2014;she would start on the inside and work her way out.<br><br>Isabel focused the steam on the wrinkles. An excited bride had wanted to find out if her potential wedding dress was comfortable to sit in. So she'd sat. For half an hour while on the phone with a girlfriend. Now the sample had to be steamed back into perfection for the next interested customer.<br><br>"Should I stop them next time?" Madeline asked.<br><br>Isabel shook her head. "Would that we could. But no. Brides are fragile and emotional. As long as they're not tossing paint on the dresses or reaching for scissors, let them sit, twirl and dance away. We are here to serve."<br><br>She showed Madeline how to hold the chiffon so the steam flowed through evenly and then explained about the layers and the time to let the dress cool and dry before being put back with the other sample dresses.<br><br>"It helps if you think of each wedding gown as a very delicate princess," Isabel said with a grin. "From a family with a lot of inbreeding. At any second, there could be disaster. We're here to keep that from happening."<br><br>Madeline had only been working at Paper Moon Wedding Gowns for three weeks, but Isabel already liked her. She showed up early for her shift and was endlessly patient with the brides <em>and</em> their mothers.<br><br>Isabel passed over the steamer. "Your turn."<br><br>She watched until she was sure Madeline knew what she was doing, then returned to the front of the store. She replaced sample shoes, straightened a couple of veils, then gave in to the inevitable and admitted she was stalling. What had to be done had to be done. Putting it off wouldn't change reality. Oh, but how she wanted it to.<br><br>After sucking in a breath for strength, she went into the small office, grabbed her purse and stepped into the workroom and smiled at Madeline. "I'll be back in an hour."<br><br>"Okay. See you then."<br><br>Isabel left the shop and walked purposefully to her car. Fool's Gold was small enough that she generally walked everywhere, but her current destination was just far enough to warrant a car. That and the fact that driving meant a faster and cleaner getaway. If things went badly, she didn't want to have to run like a frightened bunny. Not that she could in her four-inch heels, but still. With a car, there might be a spray of gravel and she could disappear in a cloud of dust, like in the movies.<br><br>"Things are not going to go badly," she told herself. "Things are going to go great. I'm visualizing greatness." She nearly closed her eyes, then remembered she was driving. "I'm wearing my tiara of greatness even as I turn."<br><br>She went left on Eighth Street, then right, and before she was ready, she found herself driving into the parking lot of CDS.<br><br>Cerberus Defense Sector was the new security firm in town. They trained bodyguards and offered classes in self-defense and other manly things. Isabel wasn't clear on the details. She found that she and exercise had a much better relationship if they avoided each other.<br><br>She parked next to a wicked-looking muscle car from maybe the 1960s, a large black Jeep tragically painted with flames and a monster Harley. Her Prius looked desperately out of place. Not to mention small.<br><br>Now that she wasn't driving, it was safe for her to close her eyes. She did and tried to visualize, but her stomach was churning too much for her to do much more than worry about throwing up.<br><br>"This is stupid!" she announced and opened her eyes. "I can do it. I can have a reasonable conversation with an old friend."<br><br>Only Ford Hendrix wasn't an old friend and the talk was going to be about how, despite her vow to love him forever, the ten years she'd spent writing him, not to mention the pictures she'd sent, he had no reason to be afraid of her. Because she thought that he might be. Just a little.<br><br>She doubted it was anything he would admit. The man had been a SEAL. She knew that, in addition, he'd been part of a special joint task force that had been even more dangerous. She also knew he'd returned to Fool's Gold nearly three months ago, and in all that time, they'd managed to avoid each other. But that wasn't possible anymore.<br><br>"I am not a stalker," she said, then groaned. Bad way to start a conversation. And not one designed to get him to believe her.<br><br>"Whatever," she muttered and got out of her car.<br><br>She paused to smooth the front of her black dress. It was fitted without being tight and skimmed all the lumpy bits. As much as she loved clothes, a reasonable person might assume she would be obsessed with working out to fit into designer samples. But for Isabel, the call of the cookie was hard to ignore. So she was really good at draping her curves and still looking stylish. Or so she told herself.<br><br>She adjusted her sleeves, paused to brush off a bit of dust from her shoes and then prepared to face the lion in his den. Or warrior in his cave. Whichever.<br><br>She walked into CDS. No one sat at the reception desk, so she started down the hall toward the sound of music and a weird thumping noise. She saw double doors standing open and stepped through them into the biggest workout room she'd ever seen.<br><br>The ceiling had to be thirty feet high. Ropes hung from beams at one end of the room. There were all kinds of scary-looking exercise machines, boxing bags and other weights and equipment she couldn't name. In the center of the room a petite woman with long dark hair pulled back in a ponytail was fighting a much larger man. Fighting him and maybe even winning.<br><br>They both wore protective headgear and had tape around their hands. It took her a second to recognize her friend Consuelo Ly as the woman.<br><br>Isabel watched as Consuelo swung out her leg. The guy moved, but not quick enough. Her heel caught him behind the knee and down he went. Isabel winced, but then the guy was up faster than she would have thought possible and he had the woman in a headlock. Consuelo flailed around, trying to kick him or punch him. Her elbow connected with his midsection. He grunted but didn't let go.<br><br>"You two know what you're doing, right?" Isabel asked. "Is someone going to get hurt? Should I call nine-one-one?"<br><br>The man turned toward her. Consuelo didn't. One second he was standing, then next he was flat on his back and she had her foot pressed against his throat.<br><br>"Sucker," the woman said and pulled off her protective headgear. She glared at her victim. "Are you that stupid on a mission?"<br><br>"Not usually."<br><br>She held out her hand. The guy took it and she pulled him to his feet. Consuelo turned to Isabel. "Thanks. I owe you."<br><br>"I didn't mean to be a distraction," Isabel said. "You're so small and he's so..."<br><br>The man removed his headgear and turned to her. Isabel felt her mouth go dry, which was a much better reaction than the sudden flipping going on in her stomach. She had a feeling she'd gone either pale or red and kind of hoped for the former. It would be less embarrassing.<br><br>The man&#x2014;all six feet of muscles in a T-shirt and sweatpants&#x2014;was just as handsome as she remembered. His eyes were just as dark, his hair as thick. Fourteen years away had no doubt changed Ford Hendrix on the inside, but on the outside, he was better than ever.<br><br>She still remembered him standing in her parents' living room, confronting her sister. Isabel had been told to stay in her room, but she'd crept out to listen. She remembered crouching in the hall, crying as the man she'd loved as much as her fourteen-year-old heart could allow had asked why Maeve had cheated on him and if she really loved Leonard.<br><br>Maeve had cried, too, and apologized, but said it was all true. That she was ending things with Ford, that she should have ended them weeks before. As their wedding was in less than ten days, Isabel couldn't help agreeing. There'd been more fighting&#x2014;mostly yelling on his part&#x2014;then he'd stalked out.<br><br>Isabel had run after him, begging him not to go. He'd ignored her, had kept on walking. Two days later, he'd joined the navy and left Fool's Gold. She'd declared her love in an endless stream of letters but had never come face-to-face with him again until this second.<br><br>As an aside, he hadn't answered her letters. Not a single one.<br><br>"Hello, Ford," she said.<br><br>"Isabel."<br><br>Consuelo glanced between the two of them. "Okay," she said at last. "I'm sensing tension. I'm outta here."<br><br>Isabel shook her head slightly to try to clear her brain. "No tension. I'm tension free. I'm practically a noodle." She pressed her lips together. Was it possible for that statement to sound <em>more</em> stupid? A noodle?<br><br>Consuelo gave her a look that clearly stated she thought Isabel should investigate a local mental health clinic, grabbed two towels from a stack by the mats, tossed one to Ford and walked out.<br><br>Ford wiped his face, then draped the towel over one shoulder. "What brings you here?"<br><br>An excellent question. "I thought we should talk. What with our new living arrangements."<br><br>A single dark eyebrow rose. "Living arrangements?"<br><br>"Yes. As of last week, you're renting the apartment over my parents' garage. I haven't seen you coming and going and I thought maybe it was because you were avoiding me."<br><br>She drew in a breath. "I'm back in Fool's Gold for a few months to manage my parents' store while they're traveling. They want to sell Paper Moon and I'm helping update the inventory and maybe the interior. As I'm only here temporarily and they're on their world tour, it made sense for me to stay in the house. So I guess I'm house-sitting, too."<br><br>Because house-sitting sounded better than being twenty-eight years old and moving back into her parents' house.<br><br>"They told me they'd rented out the apartment above the garage but didn't say to whom. I just found out it was to you, which is nice because you're not a serial killer and I don't want to live next to one."<br><br>The other eyebrow rose as his expression changed from mild interest to confusion. Probably time for her to get to the point.<br><br>"What I'm trying to say is that I'm not fourteen anymore. I'm not that crazy kid who swore she was in love with you. I've moved on and you don't have to be afraid of me."<br><br>His eyebrows relaxed and one corner of his mouth turned up. "I wasn't afraid."<br><br>His voice was confident, his half smile sexy, and he looked better than any guy ever had in the history of the universe. She was sure of it. Because even as she stood there, nerves all over her body were whispering about the <em>man</em> so tantalizingly close. As a rule, she wasn't one who believed in instant attraction. She had always thought that sexual interest required a meeting of the minds before there was any body-to-body contact. In this case, she might very well be wrong.<br><br>"That's good," she said slowly. "I don't want you to think I'm a stalker. I'm not. I'm totally over you."<br><br>"Damn."<br><br>She stared at him. "Excuse me?"<br><br>The half smile turned into a grin. "I was the only guy in my unit to have a stalker. It made me famous."<br><br>She felt instant heat on her cheeks and knew she was blushing. "No," she breathed. "You didn't tell people about my letters."<br><br>The smile faded. "No, I didn't."<br><br><em>Thank God!</em> "But you got them?"<br><br>"Yeah. I got them."<br><br>And? And? Had he read them? Liked them? Considered them the least bit meaningful?<br><br>She waited, but he didn't say anything.<br><br>"Okay, then," she murmured. "So we're clear. You're, um, safe around me and you're not avoiding me or anything."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Yes, you're not avoiding me?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Was it her or was he difficult to talk to? "I'm glad we got that cleared up. The apartment is okay? I checked it before you moved in. Not that I knew who you were, which was weird.

He said the last part with a smirk.<br><br>"It wasn't a real promise," she protested.<br><br>"It was to me."<br><br>She saw the amusement in his dark eyes. "Oh, please. You barely knew who I was.

I need to shower."<br><br><em>Want help?</em><br><br>She was reasonably confident she didn't ask the question out loud, but that didn't make the inquiry any less sincere. She would bet Ford looked great in a shower. All wet and soapy. And, um, well, naked. Which was really strange, because she couldn't remember the last time she'd speculated about a man's body. She just wasn't that interested in the whole naked-sex thing. She preferred quiet conversation to passion, and cuddling to groping. Of course, that went a long way toward explaining what had gone wrong between her and her ex.<br><br>"Interesting journey," Ford said.<br><br>"Excuse me?"<br><br>"You went from imagining me naked to some other place."<br><br>Her mouth dropped open. "I didn't imagine you...that way. What are you saying? I'd never do that." Heat burned hot and bright on her cheeks. "That would be rude."<br><br>The sexy smile returned. "So's lying. Don't sweat it. I'll take the compliment in the spirit you meant it." He raised one shoulder. "It's the danger. Knowing I'm a dark, dangerous guy makes me irresistible."<br><br>The Ford she remembered had been funny and charming and flirty, but he'd been a kid from a small town. Untested. Unchallenged.<br><br>The man in front of her had been honed by war. He was still charming, but he was also right about his appeal. There was something indefinable that made her both want to follow him into the shower and take off running.<br><br>She managed to swallow. "You're saying women want you?"<br><br>"All the time."<br><br>"How that must annoy you."<br><br>"I'm used to it. Mostly I consider taking care of them my patriotic duty."<br><br>She felt her mouth drop open. "Your duty?"<br><br><em>"Patriotic</em> duty. It would be un-American to leave a woman in need."<br><br>Her gaze narrowed. So much for having to worry that Ford was uncomfortable around her. Or that her letters had bothered him. No doubt he'd considered them his God-given right.<br><br>"Just so we're clear," she said. "I'm over you."<br><br>"You mentioned that. You're not going to love me forever.

Now, the group has discovered a geocache, left behind by someone they know only as the "Gamemaster." The Gamemaster leads the gang on a scavenger hunt peppered with puzzles, codes, and riddles. As the treasures they find become increasingly dangerous, Tory and her friends suspect that one geocache may be a ticking time bomb. The Virals must race against the clock to find it before it detonates and kills innocent people. While this sci-fi/mystery mash-up has some plot inconsistencies and implausible moments, it will appeal to fans of the first two books. The four Virals-Tory, Shelton, Ben, and Hi-are well defined in the course of the story. Though they are all intelligent and protective of one another, their actions are not always prudent or legally sound. The group's "save the world" mentality thrusts them into plenty of perilous situations, and simply letting law enforcement handle the Gamemaster is never a real consideration. Still, the friends admirably stick together and will stop at nothing to protect the innocent.-Leigh Collazo, Ed Willkie Middle School, Fort Worth, TX&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

They range in size from a scrap with parts of two verses to complete New Testaments. They range in date from the second century to the sixteenth. They come from all over the Mediterranean world. They contain several hundred thousand variant readings (differences in the text). The vast majority of these are misspellings or other obvious errors due to carelessness or ignorance on the part of the copyists&#x2014;such are not proper variant readings and may be ignored. However, many thousands of variants remain which need to be evaluated as we seek to identify the precise original wording of the Text. How best to go about such a project? This book seeks to provide an answer.</p><p>For some time Dr. Pickering has felt that among the many hundreds of Greek manuscripts known to exist today, surely God would have preserved the original wording. After years of searching and comparing Greek NT manuscripts, he has concluded that God used a certain line of transmission to preserve that wording. That line is by far the largest and most cohesive of all manuscript groups, or families. It is distinguished from all other groups by the high level of care with which it was copied (Dr. Pickering holds copies of perfect manuscripts for 22 of the 27 books). It is both ancient and independent, and is the only one that has a demonstrable archetypal form in all 27 books. That archetypal form has been empirically, objectively identified by a wide comparison of family representatives, and it is indeed error free. As he expected, that error-free text is not seriously different from some of the other &#x201c;good&#x201d; Greek texts. Nevertheless he has done an English translation based on it.</p><h2>Exorcist</h2><p>Father Damien Karras: &#39;Where is Regan?&#39; Regan MacNeil: &#39;In here. With us.&#39; The terror begins unobtrusively. Noises in the attic. In the child&#39;s room, an odd smell, the displacement of furniture, an icy chill. At first, easy explanations are offered. Then frightening changes begin to appear in eleven-year-old Regan. Medical tests fail to shed any light on her symptoms, but it is as if a different personality has invaded her body. Father Damien Karras, a Jesuit priest, is called in. Is it possible that a demonic presence has possessed the child? Exorcism seems to be the only answer... First published in 1971, The Exorcist became a literary phenomenon and inspired one of the most shocking films ever made. This edition, polished and expanded by the author, includes new dialogue, a new character and a chilling new extended scene, provides an unforgettable reading experience that has lost none of its power to shock and continues to thrill and terrify new readers.</p><p>When originally published in 1971, <i>The Exorcist</i> became not only a bestselling literary phenomenon, but one of the most frightening and controversial novels ever written. (When the author adapted his book to the screen two years later, it then became one of the most terrifying movies ever made.) The deceptively simple story focuses on Regan, the 11-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C.; the child apparently is possessed by an ancient demon. It's up to a small group of overwhelmed yet determined humans to somehow rescue Regan from this unspeakable fate. Purposefully raw and profane, this novel still has the extraordinary ability to literally shock us into forgetting that it is "just a story." <i>The Exorcist</i> remains a truly unforgettable reading experience.

A locomotive plunges into a creek...and vanishes into mystery. A German U-boat sends an American troop transport, and eight hundred on board, to a watery grave...on Christmas Eve. <br> Clive Cussler and his crack team of NUMA (National Underwater Marine Agency, a nonprofit organization that searches for historic shipwrecks) volunteers have found the remains of these and numerous other tragic wrecks. Here are the dramatic, true accounts of twelve of the most remarkable underwater discoveries made by Cussler and his team. As suspenseful and satisfying as the best of his Dirk Pitt novels, <i>The Sea Hunters</i> is a unique story of true commitment and courage.</p><p>Clive Cussler is acclaimed worldwide as the Grandmaster of Adventure, and his series of novels starring his action hero Dirk Pitt now have over 70,000,000 copies in print. <p> Whether it's deep-sea diving, climbing mountains, or driving classic automobiles, adventure is at the heart of Cussler's life. As Cussler himself writes, "Providing my readers adventure tales based around a devil-may-care character by the name of Dirk Pitt is only one chapter of my existence. I'm addicted to the challenge of the search, whether it's for lost ship- wrecks, airplanes, steam locomotives, or people." </p><p> In The Sea Hunters, his first nonfiction book, Cussler explores the special world of undersea adventure that inspired and has its fictional parallel in the Dirk Pitt novels. He describes his lifelong love for the sea and ships, and how his involvement with the search for John Paul Jones's famous Revolutionary War ship, the Bonhomme Richard, led to his establishing the NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency) Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the discovery and preservation of historic shipwrecks. </p><p> From the more than sixty shipwrecks Cussler and his NUMA volunteers have found, he has chosen the twelve most interesting, whether because of the ship's history, the circumstances of its sinking, or the trouble, frustration, and peril that were encountered while trying to find the sunken wreck. </p><p> With the same wonderful storytelling that Cussler brings to his novels, he describes his searches for such ships as the Union 24-gun frigate Cumberland, sunk during the Civil War by the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia (formerly the Merrimack); the Confederate Hunley, which became the first submarine in history to sink a warship; the U-21, a German U-boat, which during World War I became the first sub to sink a warship and escape; and the American troop transport Leopoldville, which was destroyed by a German submarine on Christmas Eve, 1944, with huge loss of life; as well as Engine #51, the lost locomotive of Kiowa Creek, which roared off a storm-weakened high bridge in 1878. </p><p> The wrecks date as far back as 1840 and span the continental United States, the Atlantic Ocean, and the North Sea. </p><p> As he does in the Dirk Pitt novels, Cussler opens each story with a creative dramatization of the ship and the way she met her end, then brings the story into the present as he describes the immense research and careful preparation so often necessary to find a long lost ship. </p><p> For example, he describes the tragic fate of the steamboat Lexington, which burst into flames in the frigid winter of 1840, causing the loss of over 150 lives -- but sparing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who missed the trip only because he arrived at the dock seconds too late. </p><p> There's also the odd fate of the steamboat Charleston, which became the warship Zavala and which was so horribly damaged in a terrible Atlantic storm in 1842 that it was abandoned in a Galveston, Texas, marsh, and slowly sank from view. In tracing its location, Clive Cussler finally found it -- under a parking lot! </p><p> Dramatic, compelling, and personal, Clive Cussler's The Sea Hunters is as exciting and satisfy- ing as the best of his Dirk Pitt novels.</p>Clive Cussler is the author or coauthor of over eighty previous books in five bestselling series, including Dirk Pitt�, NUMA� Files,&nbsp;<i>Oregon</i>� Files, Isaac Bell, and Sam and Remi Fargo. His nonfiction works include&nbsp;<i>Built for Adventure</i>:&nbsp;<i>The Classic Automobiles of Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Built to Thrill: More Classic Automobiles from Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt</i>,&nbsp;plus&nbsp;<i>The Sea Hunters&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Sea Hunters II</i>; these describe the true adventures of the real NUMA, which, led by Cussler, searches for lost ships of historic significance. With his crew of volunteers, Cussler has discovered more than sixty ships, including the long-lost Confederate ship&nbsp;<i>Hunley.&nbsp;</i>He lives in Arizona.&nbsp;</p><h2>Resurrection from the Underground: Feodor Dostoevsky (Studies in Violence, Mimesis &amp; Culture)</h2><p><p> In a fascinating analysis of critical themes in Feodor Dostoevsky&#x2019;s work, Ren� Girard explores the implications of the Russian author&#x2019;s &#x201c;underground,&#x201d; a site of isolation, alienation, and resentment. Brilliantly translated, this book is a testament to Girard&#x2019;s remarkable engagement with Dostoevsky&#x2019;s work, through which he discusses numerous aspects of the human condition, including desire, which Girard argues is &#x201c;triangular&#x201d; or &#x201c;mimetic&#x201d;&#x2015;copied from models or mediators whose objects of desire become our own. Girard&#x2019;s interdisciplinary approach allows him to shed new light on religion, spirituality, and redemption in Dostoevsky&#x2019;s writing, culminating in a revelatory discussion of the author&#x2019;s spiritual understanding and personal integration. <i>Resurrection </i>is an essential and thought-provoking companion to Dostoevsky&#x2019;s <i>Notes from the Underground</i>.</p></p><p><p>Ren� Girard is a member of the French Academy, Emeritus Professor at Stanford University, and the author of several books that have been translated widely.

Board of Education.Thurgood Marshall was the most important American lawyer of the twentieth century. He transformed the nation&#39;s legal landscape by challenging the racial segregation that had relegated millions to second-class citizenship. He won twenty-nine of thirty-three cases before the United States Supreme Court, was a federal appeals court judge, served as the US solicitor general, and, for twenty-four years, sat on the Supreme Court. Marshall is best known for achievements after he relocated to New York in 1936 to work for the NAACP. But Marshall&#39;s personality, attitudes, priorities, and work habits had crystallized during earlier years in Maryland. This work is the first close examination of the formative period in Marshall&#39;s life. As the author shows, Thurgood Marshall was a fascinating man of contrasts. He fought for racial justice without becoming a racist. Simultaneously idealistic and pragmatic, Marshall was a passionate advocate, yet he maintained friendly relationships with his opponents. Young Thurgood reveals how Marshall&#39;s distinctive traits were molded by events, people, and circumstances early in his life. Professor Gibson presents fresh information about Marshall&#39;s family, youth, and education. He describes Marshall&#39;s key mentors, the special impact of his high school and college competitive debating, his struggles to establish a law practice during the Great Depression, and his first civil rights cases. The author sheds new light on the NAACP and its first lawsuits in the campaign that led to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation decision. He also corrects some of the often-repeated stories about Marshall that are inaccurate.The only biography of Thurgood Marshall to be endorsed by Marshall&#39;s immediate family, Young Thurgood is an exhaustively researched and engagingly written work that everyone interested in law, civil rights, American history, and biography will want to read.</p><p><b>Larry S. Gibson</b> (Baltimore, MD) is a professor of law at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law in Baltimore, Maryland, where he has been on the faculty for thirty-seven years. He is also a practicing lawyer with the firm of Shapiro, Sher, Guinot, and Sandler. Among his many accomplishments was legislation that renamed Maryland's major airport, the Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.<b>FOREWORD by Thurgood Marshall Jr.</b><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Many works about my father have been assembled, ranging from formal works of scholarship to popular biographical profiles to&nbsp;children&#x2019;s books, movies, and documentaries. With this detailed and carefully crafted volume, Professor Larry S. Gibson has crafted a unique and engrossing portrait.<br><br>The photograph that graces the cover speaks volumes about the content of this book. The tall, striking, and confident figure is unmistakable, yet it is an image of Thurgood Marshall that is rarely if ever seen, even by those who have studied his life or who knew him well.<br><br> The cover photo is just one of countless treasures from my father&#x2019;s early and formative years that Professor Gibson has unearthed. Through the rich collection of childhood anecdotes; the insights into the colorful assemblage of relatives, mentors, and legal clients who shaped my father&#x2019;s development; and the recounting of the challenges and opportunities my father encountered in his local community and throughout our country, this book weaves together the events that formed the foundation for my father&#x2019;s career.<br><br> Professor Gibson&#x2019;s attention to detail and thorough research is apparent throughout this book. His sleuthing has led him to courthouses and clerk&#x2019;s offices as well as to professional and personal correspondence in many locales. That trove of information has enabled him to understand the ways in which my father applied his talent and skill and faced his own personal challenges.<br><br> Readers will see in this book the origins of my father&#x2019;s penchant for storytelling and his desire to act as an advocate for fairness on behalf of those who are marginalized in American society. Professor Gibson sets the stage with a gritty sense of the tone of the times when my father was born in Baltimore, which at that time was a segregated city not far from communities that often tilted toward vigilante justice instead of the rule of law. This book brings to life the array of relatives and friends who surrounded my father as he grew up and demonstrates how an early focus on&nbsp;academics and debate honed his skills and determined his interests for alifetime. With classmates like Cab Calloway and Langston Hughes, there was little room in his social circle for shrinking violets or backbenchers. And there was plenty of room for creative fun and mischief. Law school brought those experiences together in new ways and gave my father the tools he needed to live a life of consequence. <br><br>This book also details the breadth of my father&#x2019;s legal work. By the time my father began arguing cases before the US Supreme Court, he had already handled a diverse array of client interests that included divorces, simple assaults, and capital murder cases. Here, too, are chronicled my father&#x2019;s early involvement with politics, the civil rights movement, and the NAACP, as well as his early efforts to bring equality to education, voting, housing, and the fabric of American society.<i> Young Thurgood</i> provides that information in an enjoyable way, even to the point of letting us know about the kind of employment my father found after the workday was over to make ends meet. <br><br>Professor Gibson has given us a book that contains many new factsand insights and presents them in compelling prose. The result is as entertainingas it is unique, poignant, and informative.<br><br>Thurgood Marshall Jr.</p><h2>Hidden Universe Travel Guides: Star Trek: Vulcan (1)</h2><p>Set in the&nbsp;<i>Star Trek</i>&nbsp;universe, this&nbsp;Hidden Universe travel guide&nbsp;explores all that Vulcan&#x2014;Spock&#x2019;s home planet&#x2014;has to offer in an interactive guidebook.<br><br>Plan your next trip to the planet Vulcan!

Having invaded one institution of the cultural high ground after another, from corporations and churches to video games and government, there is nowhere that remains entirely free of their intolerant thought and speech policing. Because the SJW agenda of diversity, tolerance, inclusiveness, and equality flies in the face of both science and observable reality, SJWs relentlessly work to prevent normal people from thinking or speaking in any manner that will violate their ever-mutating Narrative. They police science, philosophy, technology, and even history in order to maintain the pretense that their agenda remains inevitable in a modern world that contradicts it on a daily basis. The book is named after the First Law of SJW: SJWs always lie. SJWS ALWAYS LIE is a useful guide to understanding, anticipating, and surviving SJW attacks from the perspective of a man who has not only survived, but thrived, after experiencing multiple attempts by Social Justice Warriors to disqualify, discredit, and disemploy him in the same manner they have successfully attacked Nobel Laureates, technology CEOs, broadcasters, sports commentators, school principals, and policemen. It analyzes well-known SJW attacks as well as the two most successful examples of resistance to the SJW Narrative, #GamerGate and Sad Puppies. Written by Vox Day, Supreme Dark Lord of the Evil Legion of Evil and three-time Hugo nominee who is described as the most hated man in science fiction by Black Gate and The Wall Street Journal, SJWS ALWAYS LIE is a powerful weapon in the cultural war against the thought police.</p><p></p><h2>Blues</h2><p>From the revered Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and writer, comes his National Bestseller on one of the world&#x2019;s oldest and most popular activities, fishing.

Into our trash cans go dead batteries, dirty diapers, bygone burritos, broken toys, tattered socks, eight-track cassettes, scratched CDs, banana peels.... But where do these things go next? In a country that consumes and then casts off more and more, what actually happens to the things we throw away? In Garbage Land, acclaimed science writer Elizabeth Royte leads us on the wild adventure that begins once our trash hits the bottom of the can. Along the way, we meet an odor chemist who explains why trash smells so bad; garbage fairies and recycling gurus; neighbors of massive waste dumps; CEOs making fortunes by encouraging waste or encouraging recycling-often both at the same time; scientists trying to revive our most polluted places; fertilizer fanatics and adventurers who kayak amid sewage; paper people, steel people, aluminum people, plastic people, and even a guy who swears by recycling human waste. With a wink and a nod and a tightly clasped nose, Royte takes us on a bizarre cultural tour through slime, stench, and heat-in other words, through the back end of our ever-more supersized lifestyles. By showing us what happens to the things we&#39;ve &#34;disposed of,&#34; Royte reminds us that our decisions about consumption and waste have a very real impact-and that unless we undertake radical change, the garbage we create will always be with us: in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we consume. Radiantly written and boldly reported, Garbage Land is a brilliant exploration into the soiled heart of the American trash can.</p><p>AUTHORBIO: Elizabeth Royte has written for the New York Times Magazine, Harper&#x2019;s, National Geographic, Outside, Smithsonian, and The New Yorker. She was the recipient of an Alicia Patterson Foundation fellowship in 1999. She lives in Brooklyn.The v-p of a New York City waste transfer station recommends, "You want to solve the garbage problem? Stop eating. Stop living." Indeed, to ponder waste disposal is to confront the very limits of our society. Where does it all go? Most of us are content to shrug off the details&#x2014;as long as it's out of sight (and smell). Not so journalist Royte, whose book in some ways (including its title) echoes <i>Fast Food Nation</i>. That McDonald's is more immediately engaging a subject doesn't make, say, the massive, defunct Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, N.Y., any less compelling. Royte nicely balances autobiographical elements (where <i>does </i>her Fig Newmans carton end up, anyway?), interviews and fieldwork with more technical research. Her method yields palpable benefits, not least a wealth of vivid refuse-related slang (maggots are known as disco rice). The details unavoidably venture into the nauseating on occasion, and some might find the chemistry of trichloroethane and other toxins a bit dull. As the NIMBY logic of waste disposal forces its practitioners into secrecy, Royte is obliged to engage in some entertainingly furtive skullduggery. All in all, this is a comprehensive, readable foray into a world we'd prefer not to heed&#x2014;but should. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although most of these accounts appeared before the Civil War, more than one-third are the result of the ambitious efforts of the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to interview surviving ex-slaves during the 1930s. The result of these efforts was the Slave Narrative Collection, a group of autobiographical accounts of former slaves that today stands as one of the most enduring and noteworthy achievements of the WPA. Compiled in seventeen states during the years 1936-38, the collection consists of more than two thousand interviews with former slaves, most of them first-person accounts of slave life and the respondents' own reactions to bondage. The interviews afforded aged ex-slaves an unparalleled opportunity to give their personal accounts of life under the "peculiar institution," to describe in their own words what it felt like to be a slave in the United States.<br>&#x2015;Norman R.

How would that have changed the ways that people justified their inhuman behavior? How would it inform our cultural attitudes and the insidious racism that still lingers today? We see this tragicomic world turned upside down through the eyes of Doris, an Englishwoman enslaved and taken to the New World, movingly recounting experiences of tremendous hardship and the dreams of the people she has left behind, all while journeying toward an escape into freedom.<br><br> A poignant and dramatic story grounded in provocative ideas, <i>Blonde Roots</i> is a genuinely original, profoundly imaginative novel.</p><p><b>Bernardine Evaristo</b> was born in London to a Nigerian father and an English mother. Her first novel, <b>Lara</b>, won the EMMA (Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards) Best Book Award in 1999. A former Poet in Residence at the Museum of London, she won an Arts Council of Britain Writers' Award in 2000.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Ron Charles My only complaint about Bernardine Evaristo's alternate history of racial slavery is that it's 150 years late. Imagine the outrage this clever novel would have provoked alongside Harriet Beecher Stowe's incendiary story or Frederick Douglass's memoir! But now, amid the warm glow of 21st-century liberalism, with our brilliant black president, what could we possibly learn from a new satire of slavery? Plenty. Blonde Roots turns the whole world on its nappy head, and you'll be surprised how different it looks -- and how similar. In the reverse-image past that Evaristo imagines, civilized Africans have built a vibrant culture and economy by capturing primitive Europeans and using them as slaves. This ingenious bit of "what-if" speculation provides the backdrop for a thrilling adventure about a "whyte" woman named Doris Scagglethorpe who works as a "house wigger" for Chief Kaga Konata Katamba. (She's branded with his initials: KKK.) The story dashes off the first page as Doris makes her escape during the annual celebration of Voodoomass. Recapture could mean death by torture for "the crimes of Ungratefulness and Dishonesty," but she's done waiting for freedom. "Deep down I knew that the slave traders were never going to give up their cash cow," Doris tells us. "It was, after all, one of the most lucrative international businesses ever, involving the large-scale transport of whytes, shipped in our millions from the continent of Europe to the West Japanese Islands, so called because when the 'great' explorer and adventurer Chinua Chikwuemeka was trying to find a new route to Asia, he mistook those islands for the legendary isles of Japan, and the name stuck." Historical anachronisms along with a weirdly distorted geography contribute to the novel's through-the-looking-glass atmosphere. As a rare literate slave, Doris enjoys a privileged position in her master's house, but she snatches a chance to ride Londolo's Underground Railroad -- the city's abandoned subway system -- out of the glamorous "Chocolate City" and into the seedy "Vanilla Suburbs." As we follow her perilous escape, Doris tells us how she was abducted from a poor English cabbage farm where she lived with her parents. She describes the gruesome Middle Passage, during which half her fellow captives expire or are murdered; the vicissitudes of the slave market, where traumatized family members are sold off in different directions; and the rape and humiliation that keep whyte people laboring on the sugar cane plantations. This is, in other words, a story whose basic elements we already know from Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Stowe, Alex Haley, Toni Morrison and others whom Evaristo alludes to throughout Blonde Roots, but even the most colorblind readers will be unsettled by seeing these horrors with the colors reversed. As always, the values of the dominant culture reflect its power structure; the black master's body and attitudes are the desired norm, even the ideal. "Privacy was a foreign concept to all Aphrikans," Doris says. "They said that the Europane need for solitude was further proof of our inferior culture." An expert explains that "over millennia, the capacious skull of the Negroid has been able to accommodate the growth of a very large brain within its structure. This has enabled a highly sophisticated intelligence to evolve." Are you listening, James Watson? Standards of attractiveness are similarly upended. Whyte people try to tan themselves into black beauties, and those who can afford it have surgery to flatten their noses. After giving Doris a proper name -- "Omorenomwara" -- her African owner expects her to look respectable, which means wearing her straight blonde hair in plaited hoops all over her head and going barefoot. And topless. As a "fully paid up member of the most loathed race in the history of the world," Doris admits that she has "image issues." Every morning she secretly repeats affirmations that some whyte Steve Biko must have preached: "I may be fair and flaxen. I may have slim nostrils and slender lips. I may have oil-rich hair and a non-rotund bottom. I may blush easily, go rubicund in the sun and have covert yet mentally alert blue eyes. Yes, I may be whyte. But I am whyte and I am beautiful!" The daughter of an English mother and a Nigerian father, Evaristo is a poet whose previous three novels were written in verse. This time, although she's writing in the colloquial speech of her narrator, she's still extremely attentive to the function of language, the power of words to shape reality. Blonde Roots is spiked with witty cultural references that detail the pervasiveness of racism. As she flees, Doris passes advertisements for "Guess Who's Not Coming to Dinner" and "To Sir With Hate." She describes popular minstrel shows in which performers in whyte-face "sang out of tune in reedy voices, their upper lips stiff as they danced with idiotic, jerky movements . . . singing music hall songs about being lazy, lying, conniving, cowardly, ignorant, sexually repressed buffoons." Evaristo has even reversed the dialects, forcing us to struggle with the plantation whytes' thick patois the way we have to wade through the Nigger Jim's speech in Huck Finn: "Sundays him carve tings fe folk in de quarter an don't charge nuttin but just aks to join famlees fer dinner." Trying to cheer themselves, the slaves sing the old spirituals of their homeland: "Shud ole akwaintaince be forget/ An neva bring to mind/ Should ole akwaintance be forget/ An ole lang zine." In the middle of Blonde Roots, Evaristo drops in a 50-page essay written by Doris's owner: a "modest &amp; truthful" defense of "The True Nature of the Slave Trade." It's a masterful bit of satire, with a sarcastic nod to Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Breathtaking in its self-pity, self-justification and self-satisfaction, this faux memoir is full of the scientific rationales, cultural insights and moral gymnastics that buttressed 19th-century slavery and remain handy for justifying 21st-century liberations of less civilized nations. In a moving final section that keeps the excitement pounding till the last page, Doris describes the devastating effects of racism on whyte families: fathers turning violent and oversexed; young men devolving into thugs and ignoring the noble models of their ancestors; women working to death, raising children they know they'll soon lose. The whole story is a riotous, bitter course in the arbitrary nature of our cultural values. Don't be fooled; slavery might have ended 150 years ago, but you've still got time to be enlightened by this bracing novel. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Photos.</p><p>Possessing scholarly credentials, influence, friends, and connections, "wonder boy of the art world" Hoving was the seventh director of the diverse and dazzling Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1967 to 1977. In this, his fifth book, he colorfully chronicles the behind-the-scenes activities, associations, and dealings in his indefatigable lust to make the Met the "encyclopedia of mankind's visual genius." During his tenure, the Met underwent the most comprehensive growth in its 97-year history. Besides landing collections, "gallivanting around . . . thinking up exhibitions, raising funds, and recruiting," this salesman extraordinaire spent "heady days dreaming up architectural solutions and dueling political dragons." As in King of the Confessors ( LJ 10/1/81), Hoving's style is often self-congratulatory, though he admits what he views as his flaws. With the flair of a spy novelist, Hoving--now a consultant--weaves the tale of his contributions to making the Met "a household word." Recommended for public and academic libraries.<br><i>- Vicki Gadberry, Harris Media Ctr., Mars Hill Coll., N.C.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.As director of Manhattan's Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1967 to 1977, brash, energetic Hoving transformed a stodgy, elitist institution into a bottom-line-oriented business enterprise, a modernized, expansive museum that actively engages the public. In this ebullient memoir, Hoving, who is preening and amusingly self-deprecating at once, provides a rare behind-the-scenes peek at turf wars, intrigues, fabulous acquisitions and stormy managerial battles. A highly cultivated man with wide-ranging tastes, this self-described publicity hound copes with eccentric, unpredictable donors, ostrich-like curators and angry protestors; he clashes with Robert Lehman, Edward Koch, J. Paul Getty and Jacqueline Kennedy. Hopping from Paris to Moscow to Cairo, he describes the internal controversies that have erupted over major exhibitions, giving former colleagues and critics their comeuppance.

Mackenzie has been a deputy sheriff for more than 20 years and has been training and handling police service dogs for more than 30 years. A popular seminar instructor, he has testified in both criminal and civil cases as a court-recognized expert in animal behavior. He is currently a professor of animal science at the State University of New York at Cobleskill.<p><b>Chapter 1: The Role of the Decoy</b></p> <p>At some point in protection and apprehension training, a person must lure the dog into thinking that he or she is behaving so badly that he or she deserves to be bitten. This person has had many titles over the years. When I first started decoying back in the late 1970s, I was known as an &#x201c;agitator,&#x201d; since I jumped around a lot and generally got the dogs all excited. Then I found that some people referred to me as a &#x201c;catcher,&#x201d; since the end result of my efforts was to catch the dog on a protective sleeve. Later, when I started working with sport trainers, people called me a &#x201c;helper,&#x201d; since my job was to help the dog learn and perfect his skills. Apparently, many of them felt the terms &#x201c;agitator&#x201d; and &#x201c;catcher&#x201d; were inadequate to describe the scope of the work done. These handles suggest that all the decoy has to do is jump around, annoy the dog, and take a bite in order to do a good job. The scope of the helper&#x2019;s work is, indeed, far beyond that.</p> <p>At some point in the process of my work someone called me a &#x201c;decoy,&#x201d; since I was luring the dog into the belief that I was a bad person, a violent criminal, or at least someone who needed biting from time to time. This term has proven to be my favorite in the list, since the decoy not only helps the dog learn but also often uses role deception. When meeting trained dogs for the fi rst time, the decoy performs a valuable kind of dress rehearsal, where the dog thinks the threat is real and the decoy is a stranger. Recently I have heard the term &#x201c;quarry&#x201d; used relative to my work, particularly by trainers from the western United States and Canada. It is a good term, but my favorite is still &#x201c;decoy.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>A Valuable Tool</b></p> <p>A good decoy is a K9 trainer&#x2019;s most valuable tool. When it comes to aggression work, a good decoy will have a positive influence on the dogs being trained. A good decoy can take a poor dog and make him mediocre, a mediocre dog and make him good, a good dog and make him excellent. A poor decoy can have devastating effects. An excellent dog will become mediocre or worse, as will a good dog. A dog that was mediocre to begin with has no chance at all with a bad decoy; in fact, a bad decoy has the capability to ruin a mediocre dog. In some cases, poor decoys have completely ruined even good dogs. So, the decoy must not only have skill but must also be a disciplined person committed to working cooperatively with the trainer. The decoy&#x2019;s purpose is to provide the trainer with a human being who behaves exactly as the trainer needs at any given time during the dog&#x2019;s development. Consequently, the decoy must be able to act in different manners and change his or her style quickly. In many instances, the actions of the decoy actually control the training and learning process, and there is a tendency for the decoy to begin thinking that he or she is more than just a tool. This is a trap that all good decoys resist, since there can only be one trainer on the field at a time for the best results. Many trainers, having trouble finding good decoys, and having no desire to argue with the big-headed ones they do have, learn to decoy themselves. They realize that when something is really important, they must be able to do it themselves to control the training process.</p> <p><b>A Communication Expert</b></p> <p>The good decoy is an expert in canine communication, understands what the dog is saying at all times, and understands what actions are appropriate to fit the trainer&#x2019;s overall plan for the dog. To do this the decoy begins by studying the paralanguage of the dog until he or she can read dogs well. Then, the decoy must learn how to speak back to the dog, using the same body gestures and behaviors that dogs use to communicate with each other. This, of course, requires the decoy to be in good physical shape and to have timing and coordination&#x2014;something we will address later.</p> <p><b>An Aggression Manipulator</b></p> <p>Once he or she is a competent communication expert, the decoy needs to understand the natural forms of aggression in dogs and what behaviors and language will trigger each individual type of aggression. Only then is he or she able to trigger the particular form of aggression the trainer desires at the correct time and avoid triggering aggression when the trainer is trying to do control work.</p> <p>So, in a nutshell, the following describes the good decoy. He or she: reads dogs well; is in excellent physical shape; can speak the dog&#x2019;s language; uses his or her physical skills to trigger or develop different forms of aggression at the proper times; and can avoid stimulating aggression when it is not appropriate.</p> <p>Decoying is a precise skill that requires physical ability and mental discipline. If you desire to prove your courage or are trying to impress people, please stay away from decoying. Eventually you will do something foolish and get hurt, but worse than that, you will hurt a dog, either physically or mentally. If you need to prove yourself, take up something like bungee jumping or sky diving and do us all a favor by leaving dogs alone.</p></p><h2>The Light Within Me: An Inspirational Memoir</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>New York Times </em>bestseller!</strong></p><p>The celebrated Fox News star and #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author offers a powerful, uplifting look at her life and her spiritual journey, reflecting on her family, her faith, and her successful career.</p><p>In her bestselling children&#x2019;s book <em>Take Heart, My Child</em>, Ainsley Earhardt drew on her childhood and the inspirational notes her father wrote her before school each morning.

We need to catch the messages encrypted in their culture and understand what's really being communicated. In <em>Engaging the Soul of Youth Culture</em> Walt Mueller, founder and president of the Center for Parent/Youth Understanding, helps us to navigate the troubling and confusing terrain of teen worldviews so that we can effectively and compassionately pass along good news: our God is their God, our Savior can be their Savior.</p><p><strong>Walt Mueller</strong> is president of the Center for Parent/Youth Understanding based in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. He holds a doctorate in ministry to postmodern generations from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. Walt speaks regularly to churches, public school groups and at conventions such as Youth Specialties.

(YouthWorker Journal, March/April 2006)<br><br>"Not only is this a must-read for ambassador parents, it's an excellent resource for any over-forty servant of Jesus." (Mitali Perkins, author of Ambassador Families: Equipping Your Kids to Engage Popular Culture)<br><br>"We all agree that life is changing all around us, and changing fast. For those of us committed to introducing Jesus Christ to future generations, we have to stay on top of their thinking, their worldview and their very souls. To share the good news to a hurt and cynical community of students, we need to be trained in how to 'walk in their Athens,' and to connect with their stories. <em>Engaging the Soul of Youth Culture</em> is a valuable tool for just that--Walt Mueller not only encourages adults to be proactive in our care for the young, he equips us to come alongside of them with compassion. I recommend this book to all who seek to walk with kids in their Athens." (Chap Clark, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Youth, Family and Culture, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Walt Mueller offers a valuable tool to help us understand youth and youth ministry in today's world. Walt writes the same way he talks to those of us who know him--plain-speakng, reasonable, humble, understanding and insightful. Reading this book is like having an engaging conversation with a wise friend. I highly recommend it to you." (Paul Fleischmann, President, National Network of Youth Ministries, and Chairman, WEA Global Youth Commission)<br><br>"Walt Mueller's years of experience from 'walking around' youth culture (see Acts 17:23), and his careful biblical observations, have made him one of the most respected voices in youth ministry today. With his stated intent of falling into neither trap of unrealistic optimism or unhopeful pessimism, Walt has given us a sobering, compassionate, informed and hopeful survey of adolescent culture that will be a real help for youth workers, parents, educators and anybody else who cares about teenagers. What I most appreciate about this book is not the thorough research--although it is supported by meticulous research. Nor is it the broad range of resources--although Walt's lively discussion invites comments from voices as diverse as Hans Rookmaaker (art critic), John Stott (theologian), Dave Matthews (rock musician), Christian Smith (sociologist) and the hundreds of teenagers whose hopes, haunts and hurts he has over the years carefully heard. No, what I most appreciate about this book is that this is not just a call to observe, to educate, to lament or to reimagine orthodox Christianity. It's a call to 'engage the soul' of youth culture with the historic gospel of Jesus Christ, and it's a call Walt Mueller fleshes out in full, thoughtful, vivid, articulate detail." (Duffy Robbins, Professor of Youth Ministry, Eastern University)<br><br>"I agree that the generation of emerging young people come with a unique worldview. We must understand their mindset in order to most effectively get into their world and lead them toward the kingdom. Walt has done a great job encouraging us to remember the power and opportunity that Christians have to engage a young generation in a spiritual journey. He challenges us to look back at biblical history in order to be courageous enough to move forward with the task of reaching a lost and hurting generation."

Walt takes seriously Paul's example of missional engagement in Athens in order to communicate a message that isn't easily dismissed as a blanket attack against culture. You may not agree with everything that Walt has to say, but it will make you think and help you navigate through the Mars Hill environments you find yourself in. In this book you will discover why so many of us working with young people look to Walt Mueller as a crucial resource for youth ministry."

And as he expresses them, Dirk Hayhurst describes himself as 'a real person who moonlights as a baseball player.' In much the same manner, while The Bullpen Gospels chronicles how all of us face the impact when we learn reality is both far meaner and far richer than our dreams--it also moonlights as one of the best baseball books ever written."--Keith Olbermann &nbsp;&nbsp;"A bit of Jim Bouton, a bit of Jim Brosnan, a bit of Pat Jordan, a bit of crash Davis, and a whole lot of Dirk Hayhurst. Often hilarious, sometimes poignant. This is a really enjoyable baseball read."--Bob Costas &nbsp;&nbsp;"Fascinating. . .a perspective that fans rarely see."--Trevor Hoffman, pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers &nbsp;&nbsp;"The Bullpen Gospels is a rollicking good bus ride of a book. Hayhurst illuminates a baseball life not only with wit and humor, but also with thought-provoking introspection."--Tom Verducci, Sports Illustrated&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dirk Hayhurst has written a fascinating, funny and honest account on life in the minor leagues. I loved it. Writers can't play baseball, but in this case, a player sure can write."--Tim Kurkjian, Senior Writer, ESPN The Magazine, analyst/reporter ESPN television&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bull Durham meets Ball Four in Dirk Hayhurst's hilarious and moving account of life in baseball's glamour-free bush leagues."--Rob Neyer, ESPN.com&nbsp;<br>"If Holden Caulfield could dial up his fastball to 90 mph, he might have written this funny, touching memoir about a ballplayer at a career--and life--crossroads. He might have called it 'Pitcher in the Rye.' Instead, he left it to Dirk Hayhurst, the only writer in the business who can make you laugh, make you cry and strike out Ryan Howard."--King Kaufman, Salon&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Bullpen Gospels is a funny bone-tickling, tear duct-stimulating, feel-good story that will leave die-hard baseball fans--and die-hard human beings, for that matter--well, feeling good."--Bob Mitchell, author of Once Upon a Fastball</p><p><p><b>Best Baseball Autobiography Since Bouton?</b><b></b></p> <p>Dirk Hayhurst's description of himself for the author's ID in his upcoming book The Bullpen Gospels&nbsp;reads in part, "Dirk is a former member of the San Diego Padres, and after this book gets printed, a former member of the Toronto Blue Jays."</p> <p></p> <p>I'm not sure he's correct. In fact, I'm not sure that in these times when so many fans feel like they're constantly having the wool pulled over their eyes by athletes ill-equipped for the attempt, if Hayhurst's constant honesty, his remarkable candor, his drumbeat of unadorned confessed self-doubt, and his seamless writing, won't resonate through the sport like the first true wonderful day of spring when the game and the weather finally reassure you that winter has been beaten back, at least for a season.</p> <p></p> <p>In fact, I'm not sure that he hasn't written the best baseball autobiography since Jim Bouton's Ball Four.&nbsp;For Hayhurst, who bombed as a starter for the Padres in 2008 and then showed promise out of the Jays' bullpen the season past, has written what Bouton wrote, and what a decade before Bouton, what Jim Brosnan wrote - a book that is <i>seemingly</i> about baseball but which, as you read further and further into it, is obviously much bigger than that. These are books about life: struggle, confusion, purpose, purposelessness, and the startling realization that achievement and failure are nearly-identical twins, one which gnaws and deadens, the other which just as often produces not elation but a tinny, empty sound.</p> <p></p> <p>Brosnan's achievement, in The Long Season&nbsp;and Pennant Race, was to introduce to a world which previously had no information of any kind on the subject, the concept of athlete as human being. What did he have to do when demoted, or traded? What happened when management changed? Was there a Mrs. Athlete, and could they share a martini now and again? (answer: You bet).&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>Bouton's breakthrough was to show the concept of athlete as <i>flawed </i>human being. Too many martinis, some of them shared with women other than Mrs. Athlete. Athletes who might not have been geniuses on the field or off, but who seemed invariably managed and coached by men even less intelligent. The struggle to self-start as one's team sank from optimism, to contention, to inconsistency, to irrelevance, to embarrassment. And yet, were they enjoying themselves, did their lives change for the better, was being an athlete fun? (answer: You bet).</p> <p></p> <p>And now here is Hayhurst, who may single-handedly steer baseball away from the two decades-long vise grip of Sport-As-Skill-Development. Since my own childhood, we have ever-increasingly devalued every major leaguer but the superstar. Late in the last century we began to devalue every minor leaguer but the top draft choice. If you don't make it into somebody's <i>Top Prospects </i>list, you might as well not exist.&nbsp;Dirk Hayhurst is writing of his days, his months, his years, as far away from the <i>Top Prospects </i>lists as imaginable. He is, in The Bullpen Gospels, often the last man on an A-ball pitching staff, and trying to answer a series of successively worsening questions cascading from the simplest of them: Why?</p> <p></p> <p>This, of course, is why the book transcends the game. It's not just Dirk Hayhurst's existential doubt about whether he'll reach the majors or why he's still trying or if he shouldn't be helping the homeless instead of worrying about getting the last out of a seven-run inning. He is experiencing the crisis of reality through which we all pass, often daily: when our dreams about life crash head first into its realities, what the hell are we supposed to do then?</p> <p></p> <p>Thus The Bullpen Gospels&nbsp;is a baseball book the way "Is That All There Is?" is a Leiber-Stoller pop song by Peggy Lee from 1969. It is the primordial battle of hope and faith and inspiration versus disillusionment and rust and inertia.</p> <p></p> <p>Sounds pretty grim, doesn't it? But of course therein lies the delightful twist: like Brosnan and Bouton before him, Hayhurst repeatedly rediscovers the absurd hilarity of it all, and the book is consistently laugh-out-loud funny. And like all great artists, he pulls back curtains we never thought to investigate: from how assiduously minor leaguers debate which "Come-out songs" they will choose or which numbers they will wear, to the pecking order of seat locations on the ever-infamous bush league bus trip.</p> <p></p> <p>My favorite is probably the mechanics of something the average reader will have never heard of before, let alone have contemplated. It's "the host family" - the living arrangements by which the non-first-rounders survive their seasons in the minors. Hayhurst hilariously defines such temporary homes as&nbsp;ranging from Wackford Squeers' Dotheboys Hall, to the visitations from In Cold Blood.</p> <p></p> <p>It doesn't hurt that Hayhurst is a fluid and gifted writer, whose prose can take off like a jet and compel you to read for half an hour more than you have. He populates the pages of The Bullpen Gospels&nbsp;with teammates, some identified, some amalgamated, some under aliases - and if the book takes off, ripping the Hayhurstian masks off the more colorful ones may become a low-key hobby after the book is published on March 30th.</p> <p></p> <p>The reaction will be fascinating to see. In 1970, my father endured my clamoring and bought Ball Four&nbsp;and read it himself before handing it to me: "I know you know all these words. Just don't use them around the house. Read this carefully, there's a lot of truth in here."&nbsp;But ever since, we fans have been bombarded for decades by altered versions of truth, all of them writ large and desperately trying to impress us with their essential-ness. Baseball books have tended to focus only on the big, and to try to make it bigger still. We've gone from the unlikely accuracy of Jose Canseco's slimy indictment of the steroid era, through the analyze-all-the-damn-fun-out-of-the-game-why-don't-you tone of Moneyball&nbsp;and its imitators, through what may in retrospect be seen as a Hayhurst-precursor in Matt McCarthy's fraudulent Odd Man Out,&nbsp;through dozens of historical works insisting everything that has ever happened in baseball has re-shaped the nation - Jackie Robinson (yes), the 1951 N.L. pennant race (very possibly), the 1912 World Series (no way).</p> <p></p> <p>Here, instead, will be a modest book by a modest relief pitcher who has appeared in the modest total of 25 major league games&nbsp;presenting what the modest author thinks (incorrectly) is only modest truth. He has yet to get his own major league baseball card and as I write this there are exactly two of his souvenirs available on eBay and one of them is a photo for $6.99 ("Or Best Offer"). His preface warns you if you seek scandal or steroids, look elsewhere, and the only bold face name in the whole 340 pages, Trevor Hoffman, comes across as a low-key gentleman.</p> <p></p> <p>And yet there in the prologue Hayhurst offers a key to what he has written and why, self-guidance to which he sticks pretty neatly: "I also believe there is more to the game than just baseball. For all the great things baseball is, there are some things it is absolutely not. And that is what this story is all about."</p> <p></p> <p>Of course, just as Bouton's exposure of the real flaws of the real men who played baseball in 1969 made them even <i>more </i>appealing than the phony deities into which they'd been transformed,&nbsp;the great things are made somehow greater by how well Hayhurst contextualizes them, how honestly he tells his story, and how vividly he takes us inside his world.</p><p>-- Keith Olbermann&nbsp;</p> <i>(edited by author)</i>Dirk Hayhurst is not a superstar. "Top Prospect" is also not a label that attached itself to his name as he toiled away in the Minor Leagues over the years. In the game of baseball, if you don't fit in either of those categories, it&nbsp; can almost be as if you don't exist.<p> </p><p>In his upcoming book, "The Bullpen Gospels: Major League Dreams of a Minor League Veteran," Hayhurst tackles this issue head-on, the issue of labels and identity and the problems that come along with them. For a struggling non-prospect, it can become a mind game that quickly affects on-field events, summoning&nbsp;Hayhurst's dreaded "Baseball Reaper."</p> <p>It is a battle waged by many Minor Leaguers like Hayhurst.</p> <p><i>"My dream has made me into a commodity, a product, only as valuable as the string of numbers attached to my name -- like some printout stuck in the window of a used car. The reality of my professional baseball player's life is that most people have no idea who I am, nor do they care."</i></p> <p>After "The Bullpen Gospels," people will know exactly who Hayhurst is and they should see ballplayers as more than just numbers on the backs of jerseys. Much&nbsp;like Hayhurst and others spend careers fighting labels, it is too simple to call "The Bullpen Gospels" a baseball book. It is so much more. It is a book about life, with baseball as the backdrop.</p> <p>Like Jim Bouton before him, Hayhurst shows that a ballplayer can be so much more than the average fan realizes. Hayhurst's tome is worthy of being compared to Bouton's "Ball Four" -- considered to be one of the best baseball books written. Bouton and Hayhurst both show the humanity of ballplayers. They are flawed, just like you and me, whether we want to believe it or not.</p> <p>The pedestal is emphatically removed, but Hayhurst does not take anyone down with it. He avoids using "The Bullpen Gospels" as a platform to shed light on the ugly side of the game that has been stealing the headlines for the past few years. The book can be crude and it does&nbsp;go deep&nbsp;behind the scenes, but Hayhurst does more good than harm.</p> <p>In that vein, Hayhurst let's it be known on the book's very first page that his tale strays from the recent trend.</p> <p><i>"This book's purpose is to entertain, not to name names; pull the covers off the bare *** of drug use; show cheaters, adulterers, or&nbsp; tax dodgers; or do any other whistle-blowing. If you are looking for someone's dirty laundry, you won't find it here."</i></p> <p>The only dirty laundry is probably that stinking pile belonging to Hayhurst's Minor League roommate.</p> <p>With his unique style and perspective, Hayhurst takes the reader into the grimy corners of baseball that fans rarely ponder. He turns the spotlight on life in the Minor Leagues, stripping away the myth of ballplayers as superheroes and instead revealing them as humans who deal with the same life issues faced by the people in the stands.</p> <p>That is why this book resonates.</p> <p><i>"Baseball is a lot of things, but it's not everything," he writes. "It can't make your brother sober. It can't make your family stop fighting. It can't make peace or win wars or cure cancer. It makes or breaks a lot of people, like many jobs where the folks who do it find their identity. I don't know if it should be as valuable as it is, or maybe baseball is valuable, and we players just don't use it the right way. I guess that's what I want to figure out in the book."</i></p> <p>One of Hayhurst's main issues is self-doubt. It's a problem he deals with throughout the book, which chronicles his 2007 season spent in the Padres' farm system. It opens with him pitching to high schoolers in a run-down machine shop over the offseason, bribing them with sports drinks to convince them to stand in the batter's box.</p> <p>From there, Hayhurst weaves a tale that includes plenty of moments that will have you laughing as you breeze through pages, as well as serious turns that will have you tearing up. It is not always a feel-good story, but that was never Hayhurst's intent. He was close to walking away from his career and constantly tries to understand why he hasn't already.</p> <p>On the mound,&nbsp;things make more&nbsp;sense. Off the field, things&nbsp;are more complex, and often confusing and combative.</p> <p><i>"The nice thing about pitching, I decided, was while I was doing it, I always knew what the goal was. Get an out; get a couple of outs. Life, on the other hand, wasn't so clear. The trouble was baseball was my life. The two were connected somehow, that much I knew. Yet I didn't know the proper formula and was tired of the explosive result they yielded when mixed."</i></p> <p>Hayhurst's brand of comedy is on full display as he brings the reader along for long bus rides, takes them into bad hotels and cramped clubhouses, shows the many ways pitchers pass the time in the bullpen, details things like the host family system in the Minors and Spring Training protocol, and explains the art of picking rooms, roommates, jersey numbers and, perhaps most important, the come-out music used throughout a season.</p> <p><i>"Come-out songs are selected in a much more metaphysical way. Guys will skulk around with their headphones on, iPods cranked, trying to gauge the "power" of favored songs. Then they'll turn to their teammates. "Listen to this. Which one do you think sounds more bad***?" The headphones will get passed, the music replayed, the headphones passed back. "I don't know; they're both good." Very few players have one sone they favor over all others, and it usually comes down to the wire.</i></p> <p><i>"Country boys will choose country songs -- tunes about their homeland, their heritage, and their pickup truck. The prima donna with the flashy car and the jet-setter wardrobe will select a hip-hop ballad declaring what a stunner Pimp, or Baller he is. The hard-edged guy with the short temper and addiction to Red Bull will require a rock song that makes him feel like Bruce Banner on the verge of becoming the Incredible Hulk. All these choices are safe, but the ones that make for the best are those that stray from the beaten path. Some guys may like the path they're on just fine, but personally, I believe a little originality makes a player and his tune memorable. This year I decided that if I didn't pitch well, at least I would be remembered for my song. I picked "Give It to Me Baby" by Rick James."</i></p> <p>It's these lighter moments that help break up the harsh reality of roster cuts, demotions, searching for identity, or even poor offseason living conditions. During one memorable stretch of pages, Hayhurst describes life with his gun-wielding grandma. His Minor League salary does not allow for better arrangements. Unfortunate for Hayhurst. Great for the reader.</p> <p><i>"She provided a roof over my head, and for that I'm thankful, but my life with her is far from fantasy. She'll tell you she treats me like a prince. She'll tell you a lot of things. Like how she saved Einstein from the Nazis or the stretch of Underground Railroad beneath the house. What she won't tell you is how she keeps me in the sewing room, on an air mattress, with nothing but a card table and a suitcase."</i></p> <p>Hayhurst has said that it was during this time of his life that he began contemplating this book. He was so close to hanging up his spikes and figured a writing career might be a better option. As it turns out, Hayhurst wound up compiling his book during the best season of his Minor League career -- one that helped lead to his first taste of The Show.</p> <p>To date, Hayhurst has 25 games in the big leagues under his belt. Not that many people have noticed.</p> <p><i>"The vast majority of people who love this game care only for big-time players with big-time numbers," he writes. "I wasn't one of those, but I was faking it as best I could."</i></p> <p>Well, Hayhurst has written a big-time book. That much is clear.</p> <p><i>--Jordan Bastian - mlb.com</i> <i>(edited by author)</i></p></p><h2>South of Superior</h2><p><b>A debut novel full of heart, in which love, friendship, and charity teach a young woman to live a bigger life. </b><br><br> When Madeline Stone walks away from Chicago and moves five hundred miles north to the coast of Lake Superior, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, she isn't prepared for how much her life will change.<br><br> Charged with caring for an aging family friend, Madeline finds herself in the middle of beautiful nowhere with Gladys and Arbutus, two octogenarian sisters-one sharp and stubborn, the other sweeter than sunshine.

This from the woman who had been her grandfather&#x2019;s&#x2014;what?&nbsp;Lady-friend? Paramour? Lover?&#x2014;the estranged grandfather who&#x2019;d&nbsp; abandoned Madeline to her fate more than thirty years ago. She&#x2019;d&nbsp;only been three years old. Cards had come like clockwork on her birthday and at Christmas, always with a five-dollar bill taped inside, written in this same hand: <i>Best Wishes from Joe Stone and Gladys Hansen</i>, the return address a post office box in McAllaster, Michigan. Those cards&#x2014;answered only by a perfunctory thank you and then only because Emmy insisted&#x2014;had been the sum total of her relationship with her grandfather.<br><br>Emmy had explained it all when Madeline was very small. Gladys was a good friend of Joe Stone&#x2019;s, and ladies often did do things like that, of the two in a couple&#x2014;sent the cards, remembered the birthdays. Emmy explained also that Madeline&#x2019;s grandfather was just too old and set in his ways to look after a little girl, which was why the two of them were so lucky, to be able to live together in Chicago. The lucky part was true, but the part about Madeline&#x2019;s grandfather was a polite fiction, and she wasn&#x2019;t very old at all when she understood that.<br><br> What her grandfather was in reality was a heartless, irresponsible bastard. Of course someone as kindhearted as Emmy would never have said anything so blunt, not to a child. Not even to an adult. They&#x2019;d disagreed about it when Madeline got old enough&#x2014; Emmy counseling Madeline to be forgiving, not to harbor such bitterness, Madeline telling Emmy in the sharp way of the young not to be na�ve and soft. Eventually&#x2014;well, after Emmy got so sick&#x2014; they&#x2019;d agreed to disagree and left the topic where it belonged, tucked away, not worth discussing. It was only at the end that Emmybrought it up again. <i>Promise me you&#x2019;ll try to forgive the man</i>, she&#x2019;d said. <i>For your own sake</i>. Madeline had promised, not meaning it really, just wanting the worried look to leave Emmy&#x2019;s eyes, but in the end her insincerity didn&#x2019;t matter. She&#x2019;d given her word to the person she loved most on earth, and against her will she began to feel obliged to live up to it. At least to make some stab at living up to it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Those five-dollar bills Gladys Hansen sent stopped when Madeline turned twenty-one (to her relief&#x2014;both the cards and money had made her uncomfortable; she still had them all, tucked into a box somewhere, the money unspent), but the cards kept coming, two a year, even after Joe Stone died. Nowadays they were just signed, with no message: <i>Gladys Hansen</i>.<br><br> And now this. It took a lot of nerve to ask. The idea was preposterous.<br><br> Madeline crumpled the letter into a ball and hurled it toward the wastebasket, but of course something so insubstantial&#x2014;one frail piece of paper&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t carry off the gesture. It drifted to the floor a few feet short of its mark. Madeline left it there.<br><br> An hour later she was back in the entryway, frowning into the mirror, tugging at her slip. Richard&#x2014;her boyfriend of three years and fianc� of six months&#x2014;had said to dress up, they were going someplace fancy, and she had, but she resented the effort. It was a raw night, and she was not in the mood for strappy high heels and the skimpy, clingy red dress Richard had surprised her with on Valentine&#x2019;s Day. She sighed. The dress was ridiculous. She didn&#x2019;t have the figure for it, aside from her bosom, which was undoubtedly what he was thinking of when he chose it. She was a sturdy person, not very tall, top heavy, all-over muscular from her years of waiting&nbsp;table. <i>A serviceable person</i>, she thought, standing there in front of the wavy-glassed mirror.<br><br>Brown eyes stared back at her bleakly. A serviceable, capable person with a heart like a volcano, one that was spewing out a lava of rage and confusion and grief. Oh, no one would ever guess it. Her customers would never believe her capable of such fury and desolation, the unending baffled confusion she felt as to how to go on living without Emmy. She was like an animal who&#x2019;d been blinded and N maimed, clawing and flailing in a cage. She hid this well, she knew.&nbsp;She was ever the sensible and steady one, the cheerful, dependable one, the one who made everyone laugh but always kept their orders straight. But beneath the surface, down in the tunnels of the real Madeline, a train wreck had happened. Madeline felt from moment to moment that there was no telling what she might do.<br><br> Her gaze caught the crumpled letter from Gladys Hansen. She stared it down for a moment. Let it lie there, damn it. But she couldn&#x2019;t. It was untidy, for one thing. Also it looked helpless. Helpless and reproachful. Madeline bent and picked the letter up, smoothed it out, propped it against the small lamp on the library table next to the door. Then she reached for the old navy peacoat she&#x2019;d had since the fall she almost went to college&#x2014;one thing she would not do was be cold all evening&#x2014;and the doorbell rang and she buzzed Richard in.</p><h2>Chequebook of the Bank of Faith &#x2013; Burgundy (Daily Readings)</h2><p><p>A short reading for every day.

The chapter also acknowledges the use of a PSP as an accepted teaming approach by the professional associations representing the disciplines most closely aligned with early intervention (ECSE, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech-language pathology). Furthermore, the guidance documents provided by NECTAC stipulate the use of a PSP approach to teaming as one of the seven key principles for implementing early intervention in natural environments. To further support and substantiate using a PSP as specified in the key principles, we have identified three fundamental areas of research that define the characteristics and implementation conditions of PSP teaming practices: 1) a defined team, 2) a PSP as the team liaison to the family, and 3) team support for the PSP. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the research, define the characteristics, and identify the implementation conditions required for effective use of this teaming approach. </p><p><b>A Defined Team</b></p><p>Using teams to accomplish objectives that could not be accomplished otherwise is prevalent (West, Brodbeck, &amp; Richter, 2004) in business and industry (Cohen &amp; Bailey, 1997; Hoegl &amp; Gemuenden, 2001), education (Flowers et al., 1999), early childhood (Briggs, 1997; Woodruff &amp; McGonigel, 1988), and health care contexts (Borrill et al., 2001; West et al., 2002). Research indicates that teamwork in health care has also been reported to benefit both the health care workers (e.g., lower stress, higher retention rates, increased innovation by team members, increased job satisfaction) and recipients of services (e.g., lower mortality rates in hospitals, higher quality of care, improved cost-effectiveness) (Borrill et al., 2001; West et al., 2002). </p><p><b>Characteristics of Effective Teams</b></p><p>The literature on effective teams contains many studies that describe positive outcomes for teams that use the following task and structure factors. Consider how these task and structure factors apply to early childhood intervention teaming contexts. <i>Team task(s) should allow members to use a variety of skills, result in meaningful work, and have significant consequences for other people</i> (Bell, 2004; Borrill et al., 2001; Hackman, 1987). Effective early intervention teams allow their members to use disciplinary expertise as well as other specialized knowledge and skills based on experience and other individual characteristics. As an example, a team member may be identified as needed to support a child and family member because she has specialized knowledge about a diagnosis or condition. In addition to this specialized knowledge, the practitioner also happens to have personal experience of using public transportation. The family needing support also lives in the city and needs to gain access to public transportation to run errands. In this situation, the team member is allowed and encouraged to support the family using all that she knows, not only her discipline-specific expertise. Team members' ability to successfully support a broader range of families and family circumstances is enhanced when they use the professional and personal knowledge and experience of individual team members.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The importance of a team's task is a critical component regarding inherent motivation of the team, the commitment the team members have to accomplishing the task, and the development of a collective team identity in terms of completion of a job well done. Motivation, commitment, satisfaction, and sense of responsibility are inherent to the task given to teams in the fields of health and education. For example early intervention teams are charged with and fully responsible for assisting family members and care providers in developing the confidence and competence individually needed (despite any and all challenges) to support the growth and development of the children in their care (IDEA 1997).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>The number of team members should be appropriate for the task</i> (Bell, 2004; Larsson, 2000). The team should include enough members with the necessary specialized expertise to accomplish the assigned tasks (Bell, 2004). Although the meta-analysis of the teaming literature identifies no optimal number of team members (Bell, 2004), evidence is consistent with Hackman's (1987) early suggestions that teams with unnecessary members are not as productive as teams with the membership limited to those required to perform the task. Early intervention programs are required by federal law to have a multidisciplinary team of practitioners available to families of children with disabilities (IDEA 1997). The team must have sufficient team members with necessary knowledge and skills to meet the needs of eligible children and their families for a designated catchment area.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Teams should have some degree of self-managing abilities because team self-management is related to enhanced team performance</i> (Bell, 2004; Borrill et al., 2001; De Drue &amp; West, 2001; Erez, LePine, &amp; Elms, 2002). Assigning a team leader (or facilitator) is essential in early intervention programs. Using a team decision-making process whenever possible, however, is a critical factor in team innovation (i.e., pursuit, assimilation, and implementation of new ideas). A team leader who has skills in group facilitation will most likely result in a self-managing team having short decision times, self-implemented accountability strategies, and enhanced flexibility and efficiency. Teams with much self-management also result in less need for a multitude of supervisory or middle-management positions. For example, an early intervention team that self-manages decisions related to the date, time, and length of team meetings will, in most cases, have enhanced participation and efficiency. </p><p><b>Characteristics of Effective Team Members</b></p><p>Effective teams consist of individuals who are agreeable, are conscientious, have high general mental ability, are competent in their area of expertise, are high in openness to experience and mental stability, like teamwork, and have been with the organization long enough to be socialized or acculturated to the written and unwritten rules or norms (Bell, 2004). Being an agreeable team member is identified as an important characteristic of practitioners working together in early childhood. The term <i>agreeable</i> when used to describe effective team members is synonymous with being flexible, courteous, trusting, and respectful. The term <i>respectful</i> or the phrase "demonstrating mutual respect" is pervasive across many studies (Bell, 2004; DeGangi, Wietlisbach, Poisson, Stein, &amp; Royeen, 1994; Dinnebeil, Hale, &amp; Rule, 1996, 1999; Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009; Dunst, Trivette, &amp; Johanson, 1994; Harrison, Lynch, Rosander, &amp; Borton, 1990; Lowenthal, 1992; O'Connor, 1995; Park &amp; Turnbull, 2003; Soodak &amp; Erwin, 2000). Agreeableness should not be confused with serving as a "rubber stamp" for other team members' ideas and recommendations. Team members will disagree; however, effective teams are able to reach consensus and move forward in supporting the team's decision.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Conscientious team members are described as reliable, responsible, punctual, and organized. Studies in early childhood intervention repeatedly recognize this characteristic as a critical trait for practitioners (Bell, 2004; DeGangi et al., 1994; Dinnebeil et al., 1999; Dunst et al., 1994; Lowenthal, 1992; O'Connor, 1995; Park &amp; Turnbull, 2003; Soodak &amp; Erwin, 2000). For example, being prepared, organized, and mindful of the topics to be discussed at a home visit or team meeting is a clear way of demonstrating conscientious behavior so that scheduled conversations and visits do not exceed the planned time and do not negatively affect the timeliness of subsequent visits or meetings.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Teams are more effective when the individual members have high general mental ability; in other words, the team is comprised of smart people (Bell, 2004). The team as a whole is only as strong as the weakest team member. Team members must be able to think on their feet, make quick and effective decisions, and possess knowledge and skills beyond the content expected of a particular discipline. For example, an SLP working in early intervention is expected to contribute knowledge and expertise related to communication development. The SLP must also understand global child development from many perspectives when working on a team in early intervention in order to learn from and support other team members and caregivers. Team members who are viewed as not having the knowledge or skills needed to complement the collective knowledge of the team can become marginalized and not sought out as a resource by other team members, potentially limiting the effectiveness of the team.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The characteristic of team member competence in his or her area of expertise is referenced across a number of studies (Bell, 2004; DeGangi et al., 1994; Dinnebeil et al., 1996, 1999; Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009; Dunst et al., 1994; Harrison et al., 1990; Lowenthal, 1992; O'Connor, 1995; Park &amp; Turnbull, 2003; Soodak &amp; Erwin, 2000). Early intervention teams using a PSP approach must consist of members representing a variety of disciplines because they have specialized training and often licensing or credentialing in a particular area of expertise or knowledge. Using practitioners who have recently graduated from preservice training programs is consistent with this characteristic. New graduates may lack experience, but bring a fresh perspective, new energy, and the most up-to-date practices based on current research. In recent years, an increased accountability for practitioner competence related to evidence-based practice has been emphasized not only to ensure the highest probability of achievement of desired outcomes, but also as a consumer protection factor. Families enroll in early childhood programs and partner with practitioners because they trust and presume that needed or desired experiences and knowledge are available. They believe that the team members have expertise, knowledge, experience, and or skills that will benefit them in ways that enhance their success in supporting the young children in their care. Competence and knowledge of early childhood development, family support, and adult learning are critical components for practitioners from every discipline associated with the field. Monitoring of required competencies is necessary at every level by individual practitioners, programs, agencies, and oversight systems to ensure that parents have not misplaced their trust or made false presumptions about the type and quality of support that is available.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The characteristics of openness to experience and mental stability of each team member are critical when supporting families and other team members in early intervention. A team member who is open to experience might be described as imaginative, objective, adaptable, innovative, and open minded. Openness to viewing new experiences as learning opportunities is specifically identified as an effective characteristic of team members. In studies conducted in early childhood intervention, factors related to openness and mental or emotional stability were reported across a number of studies examining effective practitioner&#x2013;parent interactions (DeGangi et al., 1994; Dinnebeil et al., 1996; Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009; Dunst et al., 1994; Lowenthal, 1992; O'Connor, 1995; Park &amp; Turnbull, 2003; Soodak &amp; Erwin, 2000).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although the characteristic of "likes teamwork" may seem like an obvious statement, not every practitioner does. Working in isolation is often perceived to be faster, less stressful, and easier to some practitioners. Teamwork requires considering the perspectives of other team members, acknowledging different learning styles, building and maintaining relationships, and recognizing that an independent practitioner does not have all of the knowledge and skills necessary to appropriately support any child and family. Liking and respecting teamwork means that the individual practitioner believes the team's knowledge is always better than any one team member working alone.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Effective team members are socialized to the organization's culture. Every team has its own way of being and doing. The amount of time a team member spends in a particular environment or setting determines how he or she practices. For example, if a practitioner spends most of his or her time in a hospital setting and contracts a few hours each week with an early intervention program, then his or her dominant culture will most likely be that of the hospital. The early intervention team will need to make time to assist this individual in becoming acculturated and socialized to early intervention practices and team functioning. This culture may be disrupted whenever a member joins or leaves the team. The remaining members must ensure that the team is not swayed to the incoming member's culture or allow the team's culture to disintegrate or depart with the exiting team member.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The amount of time committed to the team and the longevity of team membership are particularly important when considering using consistent teams for children and their families in early intervention. This is especially true for those states using broker-type systems and vendors from a multitude of agencies in which providers contract for an hour here or there in addition to their "real job" (Dunst &amp; Bruder, 2006; Sloper, 2004; Sloper, Mukherjee, Beresford, Lightfoot, &amp; Norris, 1999; Sloper &amp; Turner, 1992). Team members should be assigned to a consistent team so they can identify readily who is on their team. The system must be able to support these teams to minimize turnover, maximize involvement time, and promote long-term membership. Socialization and acculturation to the team and the use of research- based practices is more likely when team members do not rotate or change frequently. This socialization-acculturation effect (Bell, 2004; Borrill et al., 2001; West et al., 2002) is one of the most positive benefits of implementing a PSP approach to teaming. The approach adds an inherent check and balance among team members, a heightened sense of responsibility, and programmatic accountability regarding the overall quality of supports and services for all families enrolled in the program. </p><p><b>Primary Service Provider as Team Liaison to Family</b></p><p>Selecting one team member to serve as the liaison to the family and child is ...</p></p><h2>The Making of a Teenage Service Class: Poverty and Mobility in an American City</h2><p>In <i>The Making of a Teenage Service Class, </i>Ranita Ray uncovers the pernicious consequences of focusing on risk behaviors such as drug use, gangs, violence, and teen parenthood as the key to ameliorating poverty. Ray recounts the three years she spent with sixteen poor black and brown youth, documenting their struggles to balance school and work while keeping commitments to family, friends, and lovers. Hunger, homelessness, untreated illnesses, and long hours spent traveling between work, school, and home disrupted their dreams of upward mobility. While families, schools, nonprofit organizations, academics, and policy makers stress risk behaviors in their efforts to end the cycle of poverty, Ray argues that this strategy reinforces class and racial hierarchies and diverts resources that could better support marginalized youth&#x2019;s efforts to reach their educational and occupational goals.</p><p>"A rich, vivid ethnographic account of the barriers young people from a low-income community face; excellent for teaching. Highly recommended."&#x2014;Annette Lareau, author of&nbsp;<i>Unequal </i><i>Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life</i><br> &nbsp;<p>"This ethnography of the cruel illusion of upward mobility in the context of growing social inequality in America follows marginalized black and Latino youth who are 'playing by the rules.' They avoid drugs, gangs, and teenage parenthood and even apply to college, only to find themselves putting in 'mad hours' at underpaid, insecure, dead-end service sector jobs, scrambling to survive. The contemporary lie of the American dream comes alive in the everyday struggles and splintering hopes of the youths before they even have a chance to transition into adulthood."&#x2014;Philippe Bourgois, author of <i>In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio&nbsp;</i>and coauthor of <i>Righteous Dopefiend</i></p>"In a sobering and heart-wrenching account, Ranita Ray brilliantly captures the uncertainty and disappointment that prevail in the lives of marginal minority young people. Despite having high ambitions and work ethic &#x2013; despite internalizing the individualist American success narrative &#x2013; they suffer dearly and misrecognize the structural barriers that block their upward mobility. Ray masterfully documents their trials and tribulations through weaving family dynamics, school conditions, menial labor, romance, hunger &#x2013; and more. This powerful book is a must read for anyone wanting an update on the state of young people stuck in the deep mud that is the American class system."&#x2014;Randol Contreras, author of&nbsp;<i>The Stickup Kids: Race, Drugs, Violence, and the American Dream</i><br><b>Ranita Ray</b>&nbsp;is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p><h2>Why the World Does Not Exist</h2><p><p>Where do we come from? Are we merely a cluster of elementary particles in a gigantic world receptacle? And what does it all mean?</p> <p>In this highly original new book, the philosopher Markus Gabriel challenges our notion of what exists and what it means to exist. He questions the idea that there is a world that encompasses everything like a container life, the universe, and everything else. This all-inclusive being does not exist and cannot exist. For the world itself is not found in the world. And even when we think about the world, the world about which we think is obviously not identical with the world in which we think. For, as we are thinking about the world, this is only a very small event in the world. Besides this, there are still innumerable other objects and events: rain showers, toothaches and the World Cup. Drawing on the recent history of philosophy, Gabriel asserts that the world cannot exist at all, because it is not found in the world. Yet with the exception of the world, everything else exists; even unicorns on the far side of the moon wearing police uniforms.</p> <p>Revelling in witty thought experiments, word play, and the courage of provocation, Markus Gabriel demonstrates the necessity of a questioning mind and the role that humour can play in coming to terms with the abyss of human existence.</p></p><p><b>Markus Gabriel</b> was born in 1980 and studied in Heidelberg, Lisbon and New York.

Leadership Ethics uses moral theory, as well as empirical research in psychology, to evaluate the reasons everyday leaders give to justify breaking the rules. Written for academics, practitioners, and students without a background in philosophy, it introduces readers to the moral theories that are relevant to leadership ethics: relativism, amoralism, egoism, virtue ethics, social contract theory, situation ethics, communitarianism, and cosmopolitan theories such as utilitarianism and transformational leadership. Unlike many introductory texts, the book does more than simply acquaint readers with different approaches to leadership ethics. It defends the Kantian view that everyday leaders are not justified in breaking the moral rules.</p><p>Leadership Ethics uses moral theory, as well as empirical research in psychology, to evaluate the reasons everyday leaders give to justify breaking the rules.

But by looking back not just years and decades but centuries, Peter Andreas reveals that the drugs-conflict nexus is actually an old story, and that powerful states have been its biggest beneficiaries.<br><br>In his path-breaking <em>Killer High</em>, Andreas shows how six psychoactive drugs-ranging from old to relatively new, mild to potent, licit to illicit, natural to synthetic-have proven to be particularly important war ingredients. This sweeping history tells the story of war from antiquity to the modern age through the lens of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, opium, amphetamines, and cocaine. Beer and wine drenched ancient and medieval battlefields, and the distilling revolution lubricated the conquest and ethnic cleansing of the New World. Tobacco became globalized through soldiering, with soldiers hooked on smoking and governments hooked on taxing it. Caffeine and opium fueled imperial expansion and warfare. The commercialization of amphetamines in the twentieth century energized soldiers to fight harder, longer, and faster, while cocaine stimulated an increasingly militarized drug war that produced casualty numbers surpassing most civil wars. As Andreas demonstrates, armed conflict has become progressively more drugged with the introduction, mass production, and global spread of mind-altering substances. As a result, we cannot understand the history of war without including drugs, and we similarly cannot understand the history of drugs without including war. From ancient brews and battles to meth and modern warfare, drugs and war have grown up together and become addicted to each other.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Andreas</strong> is the John Hay Professor of International Studies at Brown University, where he holds a joint appointment between the Department of Political Science and the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs.

German historians traditionally despised it because it had allegedly impeded German unification. Since 1945 scholars have been more positive but the empire's history and significance is still largely misunderstood.<br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Joachim Whaley outlines the fascinating thousand-year history of the Holy Roman Empire. Founded in 800 on the basis of Charlemagne's Frankish kingdom, its imperial title went to the German monarchy which became established in the ninth and ten centuries. They claimed Charlemagne's legacy, including his role as protector of the papacy and guardian of the Church. Around 1500 the title Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was adopted. An elective monarchy, the empire gradually developed from a feudal monarchy into a legal system that pacified the territories and cities of German-speaking Europe. By 1519 it had a supreme court and a regional enforcement system ended feuding. Throughout its lifetime, the empire's growth and history was shaped by the major developments in Europe, from the Reformation, to the Thirty Years War, to the French revolutionary wars, which led to Napoleon destroying the empire in 1806. The sense of a common history over a thousand years and the legal traditions established by the empire have shaped the history of German-speaking Europe ever since. Joachim Whaley analyzes the empire's crucial impact and role in the history of European power and politics, and shows that there has never been a more durable political system in German history. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

But what about <em>feck</em>? Or <em>ferkin</em>? Or <em>foul</em>--as in <em>FUBAR</em>, or "Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition"? <br><br>In a thoroughly updated edition of <em>The F-Word</em>, Jesse Sheidlower offers a rich, revealing look at the f-bomb and its illimitable uses. Since the fifteenth century, no other word has been adapted, interpreted, euphemized, censored, and shouted with as much ardor or force; imagine Dick Cheney telling Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy to "go damn himself" on the Senate floor--it doesn't have quite the same impact as what was really said. Sheidlower cites this and other notorious examples throughout history, from the satiric sixteenth-century poetry of James Cranstoun to the bawdy parodies of Lord Rochester in the seventeenth century, to more recent uses by Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, Ann Sexton, Norman Mailer, Liz Phair, Anthony Bourdain, Junot Diaz, Jenna Jameson, Amy Winehouse, Jon Stewart, and Bono (whose use of the word at the Grammys nearly got him fined by the FCC). <br><br>Collectively, these references and the more than one hundred new entries they illustrate double the size of <em>The F-Word</em> since its previous edition. Thousands of added quotations come from newly available electronic databases and the resources of the <em>OED</em>, expanding the range of quotations to cover British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Irish, and South African uses in addition to American ones. Thus we learn why a <em>fugly</em> must hone his or her sense of humor, why Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau muttered "fuddle duddle" in the Commons, and why Fanny Adams is so sweet. A fascinating introductory essay explores the word's history, reputation, and changing popularity over time. and a new Foreword by comedian, actor, and author Lewis Black offers readers a smart and entertaining take on the book and its subject matter. <br><br>Oxford dictionaries have won renown for their expansive, historical approach to words and their etymologies. <em>The F-Word</em> offers all that and more in an entertaining and informative look at a word that, while now largely accepted as an integral part of the English language, still confounds, provokes, and scandalizes.<br></p><p>This is the book everyone had waited for. Here, in one convenient, comprehensive volume, is the complete story of the word still considered the most vulgar utterance in the English language. Rather than tired cliches or graceless jokes, The F-Word contains page after page of actual, uncensored examples of the word in all its varied and robust use, from its first appearance in English in the fifteenth century.<br><strong>Jesse Sheidlower</strong> is Editor at Large of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>.

Indeed, without religion, our lives are left without meaning and are likely to degenerate into moral chaos. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, philosopher Stephen Law explains why these claims are false and why humanism--though a rejection of religion--nevertheless provides both a moral basis and a meaning for our lives. Indeed, Law shows that humanism is a quite positive alternative to religion. The humanist is not simply one who denies the truth of religious belief, but one who believes we can enjoy meaningful, purposeful, and good lives without religion. And far from embracing moral nihilism, humanists are often deeply committed people, to be found at the forefront of many important ethical campaigns. Law goes on to show how the term "humanism" is used in a variety of ways. Marx described himself as a "humanist" but the Pope has also expressed support for what he calls "humanism." Law argues for humanism as it is most commonly understood--as a positive, moral form of atheism.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Law</strong> is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Heythrop College, University of London.<br></p><h2>Theology of the Pain of God: The First Original Theology From Japan</h2><p>Until the twentieth century, the Western world formulated most Christian theology. Fully grounded in this tradition, Kazoh Kitamori demonstrates its limitations and problems from a Japanese point of view and suggests a fresh approach to the biblical message. Dr. Katamori has developed the first original theology from the East. The gospel is the gospel of the cross, he says. God loves the objects of his wrath. What is revealed in the cross is neither the wrath of God alone nor the love of God alone, but the synthesis of the two. The author&#39;s purpose is to clarify this synthesis, identified as the pain of God. By the theology of the pain of God&#34; he means the theology of love rooted in the pain of God&#34; He brings a new interpretation to this central theme of the Christian faith. Today, Christian thinkers are calling for an ecumenical theology. By helping to renew the faith even as he seeks to reformulate it in non-Western terms, Dr. Kitamori takes an important step toward expanding the dialogue between Christians of the East and West.</p><p>Kazoh Kitamori, one of the most original Christian thinkers in Japan, was Professor of Systematic Theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary. His other books include Shingaku Nyumon (Layman&#39;s Guide to Theology), Taiwa no Shingaku (Theology of Dialogue), and Shukyo Kaikaku no Shingaku (Theology of the Reformation).</p><h2>W.I.T.C.H.: The Graphic Novel, Part V.

The youthful Queen Sharleyan of Chisholm has wed King Cayleb of Charis, forging a single dynasty, a single empire, dedicated to the defense of human freedom. Crowned Empress of that empire, Sharleyan has found in Cayleb's arms the love she never dared hope for in a "marriage of state."

Like the existence of the genocidal alien Gbaba, waiting to complete mankind's destruction should humans ever attract their attention once more.

That wind piled thick slabs of broken lake ice on the bitterly cold shore, swept dancing snow demons through the streets, sculpted knife-edged snowdrifts against every obstruction, and chewed at any exposed skin with icy fangs. Throughout the city, its poorest inhabitants huddled close to any source of warmth they could find, but for far too many, there was precious little of that to be had, and parents shivered, watching the weather&#x2014;and their children&#x2014;with worry-puckered eyes as they thought about the endless five-days stretching out between them and the half-forgotten dream of springtime&#x2019;s warmth.</p><p>There was no cold inside the Temple, of course. Despite the soaring ceiling of its enormous dome, there weren&#x2019;t even any chilly breezes. The structure reared by the archangels themselves in the misty dawn of Creation maintained its perfect interior temperature with total disdain for what the merely mortal weather of the world might be inflicting upon its exterior.</p><p>The luxurious personal suites assigned to the members of the Council of Vicars were all magnificent beyond any mortal dream, but some were even more magnificent than others. The suite assigned to Grand Inquisitor Zhaspahr Clyntahn was a case in point. It was a corner apartment on the Temple&#x2019;s fifth floor. Two entire sides of its main sitting room and dining room were windows&#x2014;the miraculous, unbreakable, almost totally invisible windows of the archangels&#x2019; handiwork. Windows which were completely transparent from within, yet flashed back exterior sunlight like mirrored walls of finely burnished silver, and which were utterly impervious to the heat&#x2014;or cold&#x2014;which passed through and radiated from windows of mortal glass. Paintings and statuary, all chosen with a connoisseur&#x2019;s exquisite discernment, added their own luxurious beauty to the suite&#x2019;s interior, with its thick carpets, indirect, sourceless lighting, and perfect temperature.</p><p>It was far from the first time Archbishop Wyllym Rayno had visited the Grand Inquisitor&#x2019;s personal chambers. Rayno was the Archbishop of Chiang-wu in the Harchong Empire. He was also the Adjutant of the Order of Schueler, which made him Clyntahn&#x2019;s executive officer within the Office of Inquisition. As a result, Rayno was privy to far more of Clyntahn&#x2019;s innermost thought than anyone else, including his colleagues among the Group of Four, yet there were places inside Clyntahn where even Rayno had never been. Places the archbishop had never wanted to be.</p><p>&#x201c;Come in, Wyllym&#x2014;come in!&#x201d; Clyntahn said expansively as the Temple Guardsman always stationed outside his chamber opened the door for Rayno.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Your Grace,&#x201c; Rayno murmured, stepping past the guardsman.</p><p>Clyntahn extended his ring of office, and Rayno bent to kiss it, then straightened and tucked his hands into the voluminous sleeves of his cassock. The remnants of a truly enormous meal lay strewn in ruins across the large dining table, and Rayno carefully avoided noticing that there had been two place settings. Most vicars practiced at least some discretion when it came to entertaining their mistresses within the Temple&#x2019;s sacred precincts. Everyone knew it happened anyway, yet there were standards to be maintained, appearances to be satisfied.</p><p>But Zhaspahr Clyntahn wasn&#x2019;t &#x201c;most vicars.&#x201d; He was the Grand Inquisitor, the keeper of Mother Church&#x2019;s conscience, and there were times when even Rayno, who had served him for de cades, wondered exactly what passed through his mind. How the same man could be so zealous when it came to rooting out the sins of others even while he indulged his own.</p><p>Fair&#x2019;s fair, Wyllym, the archbishop told himself. He may be a zealot, and he&#x2019;s definitely self-indulgent, but at least he&#x2019;s not hypocritical among his peers. And he does draw a remarkably sharp line between sins which are merely venal and those which constitute mortal offenses in the eyes of Schueler and God. He can be as irritatingly sanctimonious as anyone you&#x2019;ve ever seen, but you&#x2019;ve never heard him condemning any of his fellow vicars for weaknesses of the flesh. Spiritual weaknesses, yes; he can be utterly ruthless where they&#x2019;re concerned, but he&#x2019;s remarkably... understanding where those perquisites of high office are concerned.</p><p>He wondered who to night&#x2019;s visitor might be. All of Clyntahn&#x2019;s appetites were huge, and he craved novelty. Indeed, few women could hold his attention for long, and once his interest in them waned, he tended to turn to another with sometimes startling abruptness, although he was never ungenerous when he transferred his interest to another.</p><p>Rayno, as the Inquisition&#x2019;s adjutant, was well aware that there were those within the Temple&#x2019;s hierarchy who disapproved&#x2014;in some cases, strenuously, if quietly&#x2014;of Clyntahn&#x2019;s addiction to the pleasures of the flesh. No one was likely to say so openly, of course, and Rayno had very quietly quashed a few reports of condemnatory comments before they ever reached the Grand Inquisitor&#x2019;s ears. Still, it was only natural for there to be a certain... unhappiness. Some of it could probably be put down to pure envy, although he was willing to concede that there was genuine disapproval of such sensuality behind much of it. Indeed, there had been times when Rayno had found himself feeling much the same sort of disapproval. But the archbishop had concluded long ago, even before Clyntahn was elevated to his present office, that all men had flaws, and that the greater the man, the deeper his flaws were likely to run. If Clyntahn restricted his particular faults to the pursuit of fleshly plea sure, surely that was far better than what Rayno had observed in the occasional Inquisitor who found himself using the cover of his high office to indulge his own taste for unnecessary cruelty.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for coming so promptly, Wyllym,&#x201c; Clyntahn continued as he ushered the archbishop to one of the Temple&#x2019;s incredibly comfortable chairs. He smiled as he settled Rayno and personally poured him a glass of wine. The Grand Inquisitor&#x2019;s normal table manners generally took second place&#x2014;or even third&#x2014;to the gusto he brought to food and wine, yet he could be an incredibly gracious and charming host when he chose to be. Nor was that charm false. It simply never occurred to him to extend it to anyone outside the circle of intimates he relied upon and fully trusted. Or, at least, trusted as much as he ever trusted anyone else.</p><p>&#x201c;I realize your message didn&#x2019;t seem to indicate any immediate urgency, Your Grace. I had business in the Temple to attend to anyway, however, so it seemed best to respond to your summons promptly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I only wish I had a dozen archbishops and bishops who were as reliable as you are,&#x201c; Clyntahn told him. &#x201c;Langhorne! I&#x2019;d settle for six!&#x201d;</p><p>Rayno smiled and inclined his head in a small bow, acknowledging the compliment. Then he sat back, nursing his wineglass in both hands while he gazed attentively at his superior.</p><p>Clyntahn was looking out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the swirling snow and wind. His expression was almost rapt as he contemplated the icy torrent of white for the better part of three minutes. Then, finally, he turned back to Rayno and leaned back in his own chair.</p><p>&#x201c;Well!&#x201d; he said, with the air of someone getting down to business at last. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve read all the reports about the seizures of Charisian merchant ships month before last.&#x201d;</p><p>He arched one eyebrow slightly, an</p></p><h2>Forbidden</h2><p>Seventeen-year-old Lochan and sixteen-year-old Maya have always felt more like friends than siblings.

It is hard to believe that they were ever alive. I wonder what it would be like to be shut up in this airless glass box, slowly baked for two long months by the relentless sun, able to see the outdoors&#x2014;the wind shaking the green trees right there in front of you&#x2014;hurling yourself again and again at the invisible wall that seals you off from everything that is real and alive and necessary, until eventually you succumb: scorched, exhausted, overwhelmed by the impossibility of the task. At what point does a fly give up trying to escape through a closed window&#x2014;do its survival instincts keep it going until it is physically capable of no more, or does it eventually learn after one crash too many that there is no way out? At what point do you decide that enough is enough?<br> <br>I turn my eyes away from the tiny carcasses and try to focus on the mass of quadratic equations on the board. A thin film of sweat coats my skin, trapping wisps of hair against my forehead, clinging to my school shirt. The sun has been pouring through the industrial-size windows all afternoon and I am foolishly sitting in full glare, half blinded by the powerful rays. The ridge of the plastic chair digs painfully into my back as I sit semi-reclined, one leg stretched out, heel propped up against the low radiator along the wall. My shirt cuffs hang loose around my wrists, stained with ink and grime. The empty page stares up at me, painfully white, as I work out equations in lethargic, barely legible handwriting. The pen slips and slides in my clammy fingers. I peel my tongue off my palate and try to swallow; I can&#x2019;t. I have been sitting like this for the best part of an hour, but I know that trying to find a more comfortable position is useless. I linger over the sums, tilting the nib of my pen so that it catches on the paper and makes a faint scratching sound&#x2014;if I finish too soon, I will have nothing to do but look at dead flies again. My head hurts. The air stands heavy, pregnant with the perspiration of thirty-two teenagers crammed into an overheated classroom. There is a weight on my chest that makes it difficult to breathe. It is far more than this arid room, this stale air. The weight descended on Tuesday, the moment I stepped through the school gates, back to face another school year. The week has not yet ended and already I feel as if I have been here for all eternity. Between these school walls, time flows like cement. Nothing has changed. The people are still the same: vacuous faces, contemptuous smiles. My eyes slide past theirs as I enter the classrooms and they gaze past me, through me. I am here but not here. The teachers tick me off in the register but no one sees me, for I have long perfected the art of being invisible.<br> <br>There is a new English teacher&#x2014;Miss Azley. Some bright young thing from Down Under: huge frizzy hair held back by a rainbow-colored head scarf, tanned skin, and massive gold hoops in her ears. She looks alarmingly out of place in a school full of tired middle-aged teachers, faces etched with lines of bitterness and disappointment. No doubt once, like this plump, chirpy Aussie, they entered the profession full of hope and vigor, determined to make a difference, to heed Gandhi and be the change they wanted to see in the world. Now, after decades of policies, intraschool red tape, and crowd control, most have given up and are awaiting early retirement, custard creams and tea in the staff room the highlight of their day. But the new teacher hasn&#x2019;t had the benefit of time. In fact, she doesn&#x2019;t look much older than some of the pupils in the room. A bunch of guys erupt into a cacophony of wolf whistles until she swings round to face them, disdainfully staring them down so that they start to look uncomfortable and glance away. Nonetheless, a stampede ensues when she commands everyone to arrange the desks in a semicircle, and with all the jostling, play fighting, desk slamming, and chair sliding, she is lucky nobody gets injured. Despite the mayhem, Miss Azley appears unperturbed&#x2014;when everyone finally settles down, she gazes around the scraggly circle and beams.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. Now I can see you all properly and you can all see me. I&#x2019;ll expect you to have the classroom set up before I arrive in the future, and don&#x2019;t forget that all the desks need to be returned to their places at the end of the lesson. Anyone caught leaving before having done his or her bit will take sole responsibility for the furniture arrangements for a week. Do I make myself clear?&#x201d; Her voice is firm but there appears to be no malice. Her grin suggests she might even have a sense of humor. The grumbles and complaints from the usual troublemakers are surprisingly muted.<br> <br>She then announces that we are going to take turns introducing ourselves. After expounding on her love of travel, her new dog, and her previous career in advertising, she turns to the girl on her right. Surreptitiously I slide my watch round to the inside of my wrist and train my eyes on the seconds flashing past. All day I have been waiting for this&#x2014;final period&#x2014;and now that it is here I can hardly bear it. All day I&#x2019;ve been counting down the hours, the lessons, until this one. Now all that&#x2019;s left is the minutes, yet they seem interminable. I am doing sums in my head, calculating the number of seconds before the last bell. With a start I realize that Rafi, the dickhead to my left, is blabbering on about astrology again&#x2014;almost all the kids in the room have had their turn now. When Rafi finally shuts up about stellar constellations, there is sudden silence. I look up to find Miss Azley staring directly at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pass.&#x201d; I examine my thumbnail and automatically mumble my usual response without looking up.<br> <br>But to my horror, she doesn&#x2019;t take the hint. Has she not read my file? She is still looking at me. &#x201c;Few activities in my lessons are optional, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; she informs me.<br> <br>There are sniggers from Jed&#x2019;s group. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be here all day, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t anyone tell you? He don&#x2019;t speak English&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or any other language.&#x201d; Laughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Martian, maybe!&#x201d;<br> <br>The teacher silences them with a look. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that&#x2019;s not how things work in my lessons.&#x201d;<br> <br>Another long silence follows. I fiddle with the corner of my notepad, the eyes of the class scorching my face. The steady tick of the wall clock is drowned out by the pounding of my heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you start off by telling me your name?&#x201d; Her voice has softened slightly. It takes me a moment to figure out why. Then I realize that my left hand has stopped fiddling with the notepad and is now vibrating against the empty page. I hurriedly slide my hand beneath the desk, mumble my name, and glance meaningfully at my neighbor. He launches eagerly into his monologue without giving the teacher time to protest, but I can see she has backed down. She knows now. The pain in my chest fades to a dull ache and my burning cheeks cool. The rest of the hour is taken up with a lively debate about the merits of studying Shakespeare. Miss Azley does not invite me to participate again.<br> <br>When the last bell finally shrieks its way through the building, the class dissolves into chaos. I slam my textbook shut, stuff it into my bag, get up, and exit the room rapidly, diving into the home-time fray. All along the main corridor overexcited pupils are streaming out of doors to join the thick current of people; I am bumped and buffeted by shoulders, elbows, bags, feet. . . . I make it down one staircase, then the next, and am almost across the main hall before I feel a hand on my arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whitely. A word.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freeland, my form tutor. I feel my lungs deflate.<br> <br>The silver-haired teacher with the hollow, lined face leads me into an empty classroom, indicates a seat, then perches awkwardly on the corner of a wooden desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lochan, as I&#x2019;m sure you are aware, this is a particularly important year for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The A-level lecture again. I give a slight nod, forcing myself to meet my tutor&#x2019;s gaze.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s also the start of a new academic year!&#x201d; Freeland announces brightly, as if I needed reminding of that fact. &#x201c;New beginnings. A fresh start . . . Lochan, we know you don&#x2019;t always find things easy, but we&#x2019;re hoping for great things from you this term. You&#x2019;ve always excelled in written work, and that&#x2019;s wonderful, but now that you&#x2019;re in your final year, we expect you to show us what you&#x2019;re capable of in other areas.&#x201d;<br> <br>Another nod. An involuntary glance toward the door. I&#x2019;m not sure I like where this conversation is heading. Mr. Freeland gives a heavy sigh. &#x201c;Lochan, if you want to get into UCL, you know it&#x2019;s vital you start taking a more active role in class. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you understand what I&#x2019;m saying here?&#x201d;<br> <br>I clear my throat. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Class participation. Joining in group discussions. Contributing to the lessons. Actually replying when asked a question. Putting your hand up once in a while. That&#x2019;s all we ask. Your grades have always been impeccable. No complaints there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence.<br> <br>My head is hurting again. How much longer is this going to take?<br> <br>&#x201c;You seem distracted. Are you taking in what I&#x2019;m saying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. Look, you have great potential and we would hate to see that go to waste. If you need help again, you know we can arrange that. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I feel the heat rise to my cheeks. &#x201c;N-no. It&#x2019;s okay. Really. Thanks anyway.&#x201d; I pick up my bag, sling the strap over my head and across my chest, and head for the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lochan,&#x201d; Mr. Freeland calls after me as I walk out. &#x201c;Just think about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>At last. I am heading toward Bexham, school rapidly fading behind me. It is barely four o&#x2019;clock and the sun is still beating down, the bright white light bouncing off the sides of cars, which reflect it in disjointed rays, the heat shimmering off the tarmac. The high street is all traffic, exhaust fumes, braying horns, schoolkids, and noise. I have been waiting for this moment since being jolted awake this morning, but now that it is finally here I feel strangely empty. Like being a child again, clattering down the stairs to find that Santa has forgotten to fill up our stockings; that Santa, in fact, is just the drunk on the couch in the front room, lying comatose with three of her friends. I have been focusing so hard on actually getting out of school that I seem to have forgotten what to do now that I&#x2019;ve escaped. The elation I was expecting does not materialize and I feel lost, naked, as if I&#x2019;d been anticipating something wonderful but suddenly forgot what it was. Walking down the street, weaving in and out of the crowds, I try to think of something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;to look forward to.<br> <br>In an effort to shake myself out of my strange mood, I jog across the cracked paving stones past the litter-lined gutters, the balmy September breeze lifting the hair from the nape of my neck, my thin-soled sneakers moving soundlessly over the sidewalk. I loosen my tie, pulling the knot halfway down my chest, and undo my top shirt buttons. It&#x2019;s always good to stretch my legs at the end of a long, dull day at Belmont, to dodge, skim, and leap over the smeared fruit and squashed veg left behind by the market stalls. I turn the corner onto the familiar narrow road with its two long rows of small, run-down brick houses stretching gradually uphill.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s the street I&#x2019;ve lived on for the past five years. We only moved into the council house after our father took himself off to Australia with his new wife and the child support stopped. Before then, home had been a dilapidated rented house on the other side of town, but in one of the nicer areas. We were never well-off, not with a poet for a father, but nonetheless, things were easier in so many ways. But that was a long, long time ago. Home now is number sixty-two Bexham Road: a two-story, three-bedroom, gray stucco cube, thickly sandwiched in a long line of others, with Coke bottles and beer cans sprouting among the weeds between the broken gate and the faded orange door.<br> <br>The road is so narrow that the cars, with their boarded-up windows or dented fenders, have to park with two wheels on the curb, making it easier to walk down the center of the street than on the sidewalk. Kicking a crushed plastic bottle out of the gutter, I dribble it along, the slap of my shoes and the grate of plastic against tarmac echoing around me, soon joined by the cacophony of a yapping dog, shouts from a children&#x2019;s soccer game, and reggae blasting out of an open window. My bag bounces and rattles against my thigh and I feel some of my malaise begin to dissipate. As I jog past the soccer players, a familiar figure overshoots the goalpost markers and I exchange the plastic bottle for the ball, easily dodging the pint-size boys in their oversize Arsenal T-shirts as they follow me up the road, yelping in protest. The blond firework dives toward me, a towheaded little hippie with hair down to his shoulders, his once-white school shirt now streaked with dirt and hanging over torn gray trousers. He manages to get ahead of me, running backward as fast as he can, shouting frantically, &#x201c;To me, Loch, to me, Loch. Pass it to me!&#x201d;<br> <br>With a laugh I do, and whooping in triumph, my eight-year-old brother grabs the ball and runs back to his mates, yelling, &#x201c;I got it off him, I got it off him! Did you see?&#x201d;<br> <br>I slam into the relative cool of the house and sag back against the front door to catch my breath, brushing the damp hair off my forehead. Straightening up, I pick my way down the hallway, my feet automatically nudging aside the assortment of discarded blazers, book bags, and school shoes that litter the narrow corridor. In the kitchen I find Willa up on the counter, trying to reach a box of Frosted Cheerios in the cupboard. She freezes when she sees me, one hand on the box, her blue eyes wide with guilt beneath her fringe. &#x201c;Maya forgot my snack today!&#x201d;<br> <br>I lunge toward her with a growl, grabbing her round the waist with one arm and swinging her upside down as she squeals with a mixture of terror and delight, her long golden hair fanning out beneath her. Then I dump her unceremoniously onto a kitchen chair and slap down the cereal box, milk bottle, bowl, and spoon.<br> <br>&#x201c;Half a bowlful, no more,&#x201d; I warn her with a raised finger. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re having an early dinner tonight&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve got a ton of homework to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d; Willa sounds unconvinced, scattering sugar-coated hoops across the chipped oak table that is the centerpiece of our messy kitchen. Despite the revised set of house rules that Maya taped to the fridge door, it is clear that Tiffin hasn&#x2019;t touched the overflowing trash bins in days, that Kit hasn&#x2019;t even begun washing the breakfast dishes piled up in the sink, and that Willa has once again mislaid her miniature broom and has only succeeded in adding to the crumbs littering the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Mum?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;Getting ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>I empty my lungs with a sigh and leave the kitchen, taking the narrow wooden stairs two at a time, ignoring Mum&#x2019;s greeting, searching for the only person I really feel like talking to. But when I spot the open door to her empty room, I remember that she is stuck at some after-school thing tonight and my chest deflates. Instead I return to the familiar sound of Magic FM blasting out of the open bathroom door.<br> <br>My mother is leaning over the basin toward the smeared, cracked mirror, putting the finishing touches on her mascara and brushing invisible lint off the front of her tight silver dress. The air is thick with the stench of ha...</p><h2>Angel Tech: A Modern Shaman&#39;s Guide to Reality Selection</h2><p>Angel Tech is a comprehensive compendium of insights and techniques for the direct application of Dr. Timothy Leary&#39;s Eight-Circuit Brain model for Intelligence Increase.

Like no other writer can do, best-selling author Chris Tiegreen opens your eyes and heart to a better, more weightless way to live. Unburdened won&#x2019;t teach you how to avoid responsibility or hide from serious issues. Neither is it about how to escape and go live on a beach&#x2014;though having a couple of palm trees around never hurts. It&#x2019;s about taking the burdens you currently carry and making them much, much lighter. It&#x2019;s about transferring the weight of your responsibilities from the weak shoulders of your flesh to the strong fingertips of God. It&#x2019;s about learning to live in deep-down, heart-level freedom. And no one who reads Unburdened will walk away unchanged.</p><p>What wakes you up at night?

The contention of the book is that the model of professional ministry we have received from the past century of congregational life is imposing unsustainable costs on most congregations and parishes. In consequence, these faith communities face stark choices for which there are no self-evident answers. Shall we close? Shall we merge with another congregationa decision shaped by a primary value on maintaining a full-time professional in the role of ordained minister? Can we find someone who will do the job part-time? What will it mean for themand for us? Bivocational explores the impact on the ministry, on congregations, and on denominational polities of encouraging a way forwardone in which bivocational ordained professionals, ministers working simultaneously in the church and in secular life, come to leadership positions in the church. It explores the different sorts of gifts and preparation such ordained ministers need, and how a bivocational ethos looks when it characterizes not only the ordained minister, but all ministers of the congregationlay and ordained alike.</p><p>Mark D.

Either we have that gift, or we don&#x2019;t.&nbsp; But Allen shows that simply isn&#x2019;t true.&nbsp; Recent research has shown that there is a predictable science behind achieving commercial success in any creative endeavor, from writing a popular novel to starting up a successful company to creating an effective marketing campaign.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> As the world&#x2019;s most creative people have discovered, we are enticed by the novel<i> and</i> the familiar. By understanding the mechanics of what Gannett calls &#x201c;the creative curve&#x201d; &#x2013; the point of optimal tension between the novel and the familiar &#x2013; everyone can better engineer mainstream success.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> In a thoroughly entertaining book that describes the stories and insights of everyone from the Broadway team behind <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>, to the founder of Reddit, from the Chief Content Officer of Netflix to Michelin star chefs, Gannett reveals the four laws of creative success and identifies the common patterns behind their achievement.</p><p><b>ALLEN GANNETT</b> is the founder and CEO of TrackMaven, a software analytics firm whose clients have included Microsoft, Marriott, Saks Fifth Avenue, Home Depot, Aetna, Honda, and GE.&nbsp; He has been on the &#x201c;30 Under 30&#x201d; lists for both <i>Inc. </i>and <i>Forbes</i>.Chapter 1<br><br>The Making of a Dream<br><br>It was November 1963.<br><br>Paul McCartney woke up obsessed with a melody he had heard while dreaming. The twenty-one-year-old pop star stumbled over to the small piano nestled in his room on the top floor of 57 Wimpole Street in central London.<br><br>What was that melody?<br><br>He sat at the piano, trying to re-create the notes he had heard in his sleep.<br><br>It felt so familiar.<br><br>He finally put it together: G, F-sharp minor 7th, B, E minor, and E. He played it again and again. He loved the way it sounded but was certain the melody must come from some half-forgotten song he had heard before. Like many musicians, he fretted that he might be borrowing the melody of another song. Too familiar, he thought. Where have I heard this before?<br><br>The melody McCartney heard in his dream would ultimately become &#x201c;Yesterday,&#x201d; the most recorded song in music history with three thousand different versions. It has been played more than seven million times on American television and radio and is the fourth-highest-grossing song of all time.<br><br>McCartney himself once said of his famous song, &#x201c;It is possibly the smash of this century.&#x201d; Indeed, &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; may well have been one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s biggest hits, and, apparently, it was the result of a dream. He told an interviewer for The Beatles Anthology that the experience had a profound impact on how he viewed creativity: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s amazing that it just came to me in a dream. That&#x2019;s why I don&#x2019;t profess to know anything; I think music is all very mystical.&#x201d;<br><br>For creativity researchers, Paul McCartney&#x2019;s sudden melodic epiphany is a classic example of creativity coming to an artist unplanned, in a flash of genius: a &#x201c;moment of inspiration,&#x201d; in which an idea suddenly rises to one&#x2019;s conscious awareness. It is the unexpected nature of these bursts of inspiration, with no apparent origin, that gives them a supernatural quality. Anyone who has had a great idea in the shower or on a run or walk has experienced some version of these moments.<br><br>Whether it is J. K. Rowling being struck with the idea for Harry Potter on a train to London, or Mozart being able to compose songs without effort, these accounts have become modern-day staples of what I call the inspiration theory of creativity: the idea that creative success results from a mysterious internal process punctuated by unpredictable flashes of genius. And our culture has embraced the idea that a self-reliant person, born with the right innate talents, can produce hits out of sheer inspiration.<br><br>What&#x2019;s more, this view is not confined to the traditional arts, like music and literature. Steve Jobs, the prototypical genius of the digital age, explained, in an often-repeated quote, that creativity is an organic process: &#x201c;When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn&#x2019;t really do it, they just saw something.&#x201d;<br><br>The inspiration theory of creativity dominates how most people think about creative greatness today. But why do these sudden moments of inspiration occur? Is sheer IQ genius the only explanation? If we studied the settings of these creative moments, would they verify or disprove the inspiration theory?<br><br>Name That Tune<br><br>The morning the melody for &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; came to McCartney was a typical lazy day. As was his routine, he awoke around noon. He and his girlfriend Jane would often stay out late at London&#x2019;s restaurants and clubs.<br><br>McCartney worried about why the melody he woke up with was so clear, so concise. It seemed too finished, too complete. He assumed he had accidently plagiarized it. Was it from one of the classics he had heard his father play so often? &#x201c;Stairway to Paradise&#x201d;? &#x201c;Chicago&#x201d;? &#x201c;Lullaby of the Leaves&#x201d;?<br><br>The Beatles were thoughtful about creating their hits. Lennon once described to an interviewer how intentional the band had been when writing their first number-one single, &#x201c;Please Please Me&#x201d;: &#x201c;We tried to make it as simple as possible . . . we aimed this one straight at the hit parade. It was my attempt at writing a Roy Orbison song.&#x201d;<br><br>For McCartney, &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; was an explicit exception to his typical methodical songwriting process. The tune of &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; was like &#x201c;a jazz melody,&#x201d; McCartney later said. &#x201c;My dad used to know a lot of old jazz tunes. I thought maybe I&#x2019;d just remembered it from the past.&#x201d;<br><br>He went to his friends and asked if they recognized the song.<br><br>First, he asked his songwriting partner, John Lennon. Lennon told him he had never heard it before. Still skeptical, McCartney tried his friend Lionel Bart, who had composed numerous hit songs. When McCartney hummed the melody, Bart drew a blank. It seemed as if the song might be original.<br><br>Still not convinced, McCartney pressed on. He tried to think of someone older and more experienced, someone who might be able to clear his conscience.<br><br>A few days later, McCartney visited Alma Cogan, a British singer known for the song &#x201c;Dreamboat&#x201d; and sixteen other hits. If anyone could recognize the song, she could.<br><br>He sat down at the piano and played the melody for Cogan and her sister. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s lovely,&#x201d; Cogan said when he was done.<br><br>Had she heard it before? McCartney asked. Was it someone else&#x2019;s song?<br><br>Cogan said, &#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s original. Nice song.&#x201d;<br><br>Finally, McCartney was persuaded. He had seemingly dreamed a masterful melody, following the mystical nature of the inspiration theory of creativity.<br><br>We can interpret the inspiration theory in one of two ways.<br><br>The positive view is that a flash of genius can strike anyone. &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; came to McCartney in a dream, outside of his control. It&#x2019;s possible that all of us can dream a chart-topping melody.<br><br>On the other hand, most of us believe that if we lack the raw talent or innate genius, these moments will never strike. The inspiration theory of creativity is only relevant for those born with so-called genius.<br><br>As a result, many of us are tempted to put aside any ambition to become the next great musician, novelist, or entrepreneur, settling instead to be a consumer or patron of the arts. Meanwhile, the optimistic ones are just waiting, hoping for a sudden flash of inspiration to visit them.<br><br>The inspiration theory is supported by countless anecdotes from the creative artists of our time. Authors talk of waiting for creative inspiration. Entrepreneurs talk of waiting for a great idea to strike. Musicians talk of falling into a creative groove.<br><br>There are countless books and blog posts on creativity, offering suggestions on how we can push through writer&#x2019;s block or discover our &#x201c;flow.&#x201d; Biopics of great artists amplify the inevitability of their creativity, as well as suggesting it is the domain of mad geniuses.<br><br>Meanwhile, the rest of us are left on the sidelines.<br><br>But what if this entire theory is wrong? What if you don&#x2019;t have to wait for lightning to strike?<br><br>The Road to &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d;<br><br>While the sudden creation story of &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; is relatively well known, what is less known is how McCartney went from the original melody to crafting the full song.<br><br>The notion that this song came to McCartney in an instant is wrong.<br><br>All that had come to him in the dream was a simple chord progression. When McCartney awoke with a melody in his head, it was a long way from a completed song. For one thing, the tune had no words. He knew he needed to come up with placeholder lyrics while he continued working on the song&#x2019;s structure.<br><br>As he was playing the melody to Alma Cogan, her mother walked into the room, asking, &#x201c;Anyone like some scrambled eggs?&#x201d;<br><br>This gave McCartney the temporary lyric he needed: Scrambled Eggs.<br><br>The initial lyrics he came up with were:<br><br>Scrambled eggs<br><br>Oh, my baby, how I love your legs<br><br>Diddle diddle<br><br>I believe in scrambled eggs.<br><br>From there, it took almost twenty months of grueling work to complete the song. McCartney became obsessed. While he worked on it, the people around McCartney became sick of hearing about his ever-changing song in progress.<br><br>As George Harrison told an interviewer about that period, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s always talking about that song. You&#x2019;d think he was Beethoven or somebody . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Even when the Beatles started filming their second movie, Help!, McCartney didn&#x2019;t waver. He worked on the song during breaks. At one point, the film&#x2019;s producer, Dick Lester, was so fed up that he said, &#x201c;If you play that bloody song any longer, I&#x2019;ll have the piano taken offstage. Either finish it, or give it up!&#x201d;<br><br>Later, on their first tour through France, Paul had a piano placed in their hotel room so that he could continue working on &#x201c;Yesterday.&#x201d; It paid off. When producer George Martin first heard the song, he was mesmerized. It was different. In fact, it was so original that he was worried that it wouldn&#x2019;t fit into a Beatles album.<br><br>McCartney realized that the song needed melancholy lyrics (scrambled eggs were not a valid topic for a brooding song). &#x201c;I remember thinking that people liked sad tunes; they like to wallow a bit when they&#x2019;re alone, to put a record on and go, &#x2018;Ahh.&#x2019; &#x201d; He finally finished the song, sketching out the final lyrics, on a trip to Portugal in May 1965.<br><br>A month later he went to the studio with George Martin to record &#x201c;Yesterday.&#x201d; According to Martin, McCartney came into Studio Two at EMI and played &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; on an acoustic guitar. The only change Martin could think of adding was orchestral strings. Paul, however, thought that was too much. In response, Martin suggested a quartet, and with that melodic but dark addition, &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; was born.<br><br>The iconic song that is remembered as the result of a flash of genius was, in fact, a nearly two-year odyssey&#x2014;�one that at times wore McCartney (and his friends) down. While the mythology behind the Beatles celebrates the story of &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; as one of sudden creative genius, as we&#x2019;ve seen it was hardly a linear path from dream to recording. &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; was not a pure product of a light-bulb moment. It was hard, grueling work.<br><br>But couldn&#x2019;t you argue that it began with an initial moment of divine inspiration? How do we account for that?<br><br>There is a cottage industry of researchers who are fascinated by the origin story of &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d;: academics interested in creativity, music historians, and avid Beatles fans. All have worked to answer the question of where the melody really came from.<br><br>The most enlightening theory of the origin of &#x201c;Yesterday&#x201d; comes from Beatles expert Ian Hammond, who points out that the song &#x201c;is a direct evolution of the melody from the Ray Charles version of &#x2018;Georgia on My Mind.&#x2019; Not only does &#x2018;Yesterday&#x2019; share a chord progression with the earlier song, but it also mirrors the bass lines of &#x2018;Georgia on My Mind.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>True enough, the Beatles and Paul McCartney were big admirers of Ray Charles. They kicked off their career playing his covers in the bars and clubs of Hamburg, Germany. John Lennon said that when they started playing their own songs, it was a &#x201c;quite traumatic thing because we were doing such great numbers of other people&#x2019;s, of Ray Charles and [Little] Richard and all of them.&#x201d;<br><br>For Paul McCartney, what looked like divine inspiration was in fact likely the result of subconscious processing of music he loved. Like most music, it was an evolution of the chord progressions that already existed. In fact, as Hammond points out, Ray Charles&#x2019;s version of &#x201c;Georgia on My Mind&#x201d; was an evolution of Hoagy Carmichael&#x2019;s original version of the song. This type of ingestion, reinvention, and influence is common in stories of creative success.<br><br>When McCartney reflects on how he wrote &#x201c;Yesterday,&#x201d; he tends to focus on his sudden inspiration for the tune. But, in at least one interview, he acknowledged that there was something more mechanical at work: &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re very spiritual then God sent me a melody, I&#x2019;m a mere vehicle. If you wanna be a bit more cynical, then I was loading my computer for millions of years listening to all the stuff I listened to through my dad and through my musical tastes, including people like Fred Astaire, Gershwin, and finally my computer printed out one morning what it thought was a good tune.&#x201d;<br><br>The things we view as unexplainable genius often have a genesis of some sort.<br><br>The inspiration theory of creativity has been around for thousands of years, since the era of ancient Greece. While the theory is still breathlessly recounted in the press, modern research that I&#x2019;ll discuss demonstrates that creative potential is within all of us.<br><br>However, if our perception of McCartney and other creative artists is flawed&#x2014;�if they are more accurately described as tireless and intensely focused&#x2014;�that still does not explain how they achieved commercial success. Plenty of artists toil away for years at their craft without recognition or acclaim. An endless procession of novelists has labored tirelessly for years writing novels that never sell a copy. Many painters, sculptors, choreographers, and musicians work for years without ever tasting critical or commercial success. Clearly, popular success is not just a matter of sweat equity.<br><br>Could it be possible to identify the true causes of creative success?<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>Learning a Lie<br><br>As I said earlier, I have always been addicted to recognizing patterns. Much of the phenomena we observe that seem organic or unique are actually the result of repeating processes and systems. By decoding the right patterns, I believe you can achieve goals ranging from the frivolous to the meaningful.<br><br>When I was eighteen, I set my sights on getting on a game show. It seemed like an unusual challenge, yet one that offered a potentially fun and lucrative reward. So, I applied to all the shows I had heard of (and some I hadn&#x2019;t known existed).<br><br>Some asked for essays. Others, like Jeopardy, asked you to take online tests. Still others, like Wheel of Fortune, simply requested you fill out a form.<br><br>I sent away e-mails and filled out web forms, and then I waited.<br><br>After months of not hearing anything, one day an e-mail appeared asking me to audition for Wheel of Fortune. Rather than study the puzzles, I decided I would spend the weeks before my audition trying to figure out what the producers wanted. I watched dozens of episodes, looking for common elements in the �contestants&#x2019; behavior. I delved through message boards about how the game worked, and read blog posts about other peoples&#x2019; experiences auditioning. After hours of research, I found a pattern: the casting team wasn&#x2019;t looking for expert puzzle-solvers. They were seeking contestants who could enunciate (and really loudly, too), were willing to embarrass themselves, and who came across to a home audience as over-the-top and energetic.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why instead of studying vocab words, I came up with various ways I could embarrass myself. I worked on an Elmo impression that I thought might make the audience laugh&#x2014;�or cringe&#x2014;�and on the morning of my audition, I drank two shots of espresso. A lack of energy would not be an obstacle.</p><h2>The Way of Aikido: Life Lessons From An American Sensei</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This book is a warmhearted handshake, a graceful and practical invitation to enter and blend with the <i>ahhh</i> of the world.

But while the world is awash in negativity, Christians have resources to live differently.</p><p>In <em>The Happy Christian</em>, professor and pastor David Murray blends the best of modern science and psychology with the timeless truths of Scripture to create a solid, credible guide to positivity. The author of the acclaimed <em>Christians Get Depressed Too</em>, Murray exposes modern negativity&#x2019;s insidious roots and presents ten perspective-changing ways to remain optimistic in a world that keeps trying to drag us down.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Happy Christian</em> invites readers to shed negativity and become countercultural missionaries by demonstrating the positive power of the gospel in their lives.</p></p><p>Over the past few years, there have been a number of bestselling books on happiness and especially the scientific study of happiness. As I was reading these popular books, I thought, "This is really good and helpful; but surely, as Christians, we can do even better. If scientists can discover many techniques to make people happy, surely Christians have many truths to make people happy."<br> <br>That started me on an incredibly enjoyable plunge into happiness research and the result is this book, <b><i>The Happy Christian</i></b>, which not only presents the best "happiness science" can offer us, but also promotes the superior findings of God's Word and the Gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br> <br>I have two aims in this. First, I want to make Christians happier, to grow in Christian joy, not only because we're commanded to, but also because of the demonstrated benefits of happiness in every aspect of our lives. Second, I want to draw non-Christians to the Christian faith by showing the positive benefits of joyful Christianity, not only for eternity, but also for everyday life.&nbsp;<br> <br>In summary, <b><i>The Happy Christian</i></b> identifies the causes of the demoralizing plague of negativity, both in society and the church, and proposes 10 biblical and practical methods to re-balance our attitude, outlook, words, and actions in a way that will lift the spirits of Christians, compel attention for the Christian faith, draw people to Jesus, and make the church a beacon of hope in a world of despair.Dr. David Murray is Professor of Old Testament and Practical Theology at <i>Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary</i> and Pastor of <i>Grand Rapids Free Reformed Church</i>.<br> <br> He is the author of <i>Christians Get Depressed Too</i>, <i>How Sermons Work</i>, <i>Jesus on Every Page</i>, <i>The Happy Christian</i>, <i>A Bundle of Joy: Six Books On Christian Happiness</i>, <i>The Christian Ministry</i>, <i>The Christian Life</i>, and <i>God's Mobile Home: Stories of Grace from the Tabernacle. </i>He also blogs at HeadHeartHand.org.<br> <br> He is married to Shona and they have five children ranging from 2 to 19 years old.

With the combination of humor and erudition that has distinguished her as one of our finest essayists, Fadiman draws us into twelve of her personal obsessions: from her slightly sinister childhood enthusiasm for catching butterflies to her monumental crush on Charles Lamb, from her wistfulness for the days of letter-writing to the challenges and rewards of moving from the city to the country.</p><p>Many of these essays were composed "under the influence" of the subject at hand. Fadiman ingests a shocking amount of ice cream and divulges her passion for H�agen-Dazs Chocolate Chocolate Chip and her brother's homemade Liquid Nitrogen Kahl�a Coffee (recipe included); she sustains a terrific caffeine buzz while recounting Balzac's coffee addiction; and she stays up till dawn to write about being a night owl, examining the rhythms of our circadian clocks and sharing such insomnia cures as her father's nocturnal word games and Lewis Carroll's mathematical puzzles. <i>At Large and At Small </i>is a brilliant and delightful collection of essays that harkens a revival of a long-cherished genre.</p></p><p><p><b>Anne Fadiman</b> is the author of <i>The Spirit Catches You</i> and <i>You Fall Down</i>, winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award, an <i>L.A. Times</i> Book Prize, and a Salon Book Award. She is also the author of the essay collection <i>Ex Libris</i> and the editor of <i>Rereadings: Seventeen Writers Revisit Books They Love</i>. Her essays and articles have appeared in <i>Harper's, The New Yorker</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>, among other publications. She is the Francis Writer-in-Residence at Yale.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Fadiman, a National Book Critics Circle Award winner for <i>The Spirit Catches You and You Fall</i>, makes a bold claim: "I believe the survival of the familiar essay is worth fighting for." The "familiar essays" that Fadiman champions and writes are in the mold of the early 19th century, rather than critical or personal works as we've come to know them. Her essays combine a personal perspective with a far-reaching curiosity about the world, resulting in pieces that are neither so objective the reader can't see the writer behind them nor too self-absorbed. And spending some time with Fadiman is a pure delight. She loves the natural world and taxonomies of all kinds, as well as ice cream and coffee. Her love of the romantic age goes beyond the stylistic, and she prefers Coleridge and Lamb over Wordsworth and Southey. The collection rolls good-naturedly through its subjects until the final piece&#x2014;an account of a whitewater rafting trip that went tragically awry, a harrowing reminder of the stakes on which all endeavors rest. This collection is a perfectly faceted little gem. Essayists, of both the critical and personal sort, could do worse than to follow Fadiman into the realm of the familiar.<i> (May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch has retired from the Los Angeles Police Department - but the discovery of a startling unsolved murder among his old case files means he cannot rest until he finds the killer. </b></p><p>When he left the LAPD, Bosch took a file with him: the case of a production assistant murdered four years earlier during a movie set robbery. The LAPD thinks the stolen money was used to finance a terrorist training camp. Thoughts of the original murder victim were lost in the federal zeal, and when Bosch decides to reinvestigate, he quickly falls foul of both his old colleagues and the FBI. </p><p>When the private investigation enables him to meet up with an old friend, shadows from his past come back to haunt him . . .</p></p><p>Michael Connelly (born July 21, 1956, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American author of detective novels, notably those featuring Detective Hieronymus &#34;Harry&#34; Bosch. Bosch, named after the Dutch painter of the same name, is the protagonist of a series of Connelly&#39;s novels. The character is an LAPD detective. The Black Echo, the first book featuring Bosch, won the Mystery Writers of America&#39;s Edgar Award for Best First Novel of 1992. Connelly has written other books outside the Bosch series, including Blood Work, which was made into a 2002 movie directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. In 2006, The Lincoln Lawyer was selected as one of ten books to feature in Richard and Judy&#39;s televised book club. Connelly is a graduate of the University of Florida, where he earned a bachelors degree in journalism. In addition to his books, Connelly has written for television.This is a police procedural, even though the protagonist, Harry Bosch, is an ex-cop. Bosch sets out to solve a four- year-old robbery and murder, and learns that an FBI agent who worked on the robbery investigation vanished in the midst of it and hasn't been seen since. Bosch gets seriously on the wrong side of the FBI, complicating an already complicated inquiry. Len Cariou keeps the listener completely involved. His nuanced, well-paced reading draws one into the action, not letting us sit back as passive listeners. And his Harry Bosch is entirely believable--tired, a bit jaded, yet fiercely on the case.

He smelled of the sweat of violence, and was covered in the blood of monsters. Even the small victories they managed were not enough to take away the true stink of their failure.<br> <br>Aaron opened his wings in the former library that now served as their television room, to see that he wasn&#x2019;t the first to return. He could hear the chatter of one of the twenty-four-hour news channels they always had on now.<br> <br>The Nephilim, the blending of humanity and the angelic in the perfect amalgam of God&#x2019;s most cherished creations, were supposed to keep the world from harm. They had fought hard against those who had considered them a blight in the eyes of God, and had won the honor of being the earth&#x2019;s protectors against the unnatural.<br> <br>But then a heavenly threat had arisen. The Abomination of Desolation, an angel of destruction, had come to the world of man. He&#x2019;d believed the earth was ripe with evil, and had attempted to destroy the planet.<br> <br>The Nephilim had fought valiantly. Many had sacrificed their lives for what was only a partial victory. They had prevented the Abomination from ending the world, but they had not been able to stop it from severing the world&#x2019;s ties to God and Heaven.<br> <br>And now humanity was suffering. Creatures that had hidden in shadow began to emerge to claim their stake in a world that seemed to have been abandoned by the Lord.<br> <br>The first thing Aaron&#x2019;s eyes locked upon in the room was Vilma, and he was reminded of how beautiful his girlfriend was, and how much he loved her.<br> <br>As if sensing his stare, Vilma turned to look at him. Behind her, Kraus, their resident healer, worked to clean up the newest injuries of the other two Nephilim who&#x2019;d been out on their own missions. Melissa seemed to have injured her hand. It was bandaged, and she flexed and released it, testing her range of motion, as Kraus tended to a nasty-looking gash on Cameron&#x2019;s cheek.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are they all right?&#x201d; Aaron asked Vilma as she came toward him.<br> <br>Hearing his voice, Gabriel, who had been sleeping in a patch of sunshine, jumped to his feet with a loud bark and ran to his master.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re fine, but I should be asking you the same question,&#x201d; Vilma said, eyeing him.<br> <br>Aaron looked down at himself. His clothes were caked with blood and the filth of violent death.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;You stink,&#x201d;</i> Gabriel said, then sneezed violently.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Aaron shrugged.<br> <br>Earlier he had seen a report on CNN that monsters had taken up residence under the Golden Gate Bridge, preventing any travel between San Francisco and Marin County. Local law enforcement, and even the National Guard, had been called in to deal with these creatures identified as a species of Asian troll called Oni&#x2014;but the loss of life had been great.<br> <br>People... civilians... were not meant to deal with creatures such as these, which was why he had stepped in. Normally Aaron wouldn&#x2019;t have gone alone, but there were other threats, other beasts emerging around the world, so they&#x2019;d split up.<br> <br>So many monsters out there now, and so few Nephilim.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my blood,&#x201d; Aaron replied. He flexed the muscles in his back, drawing his black wings beneath his flesh. He suddenly felt spasms of pain across his body, and stumbled slightly, dropping to one knee on the floor. &#x201c;Well, not all of it anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vilma was by his side in an instant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Think the fight might have taken a little bit more out of me than I thought,&#x201d; Aaron said.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d flown to the Golden Gate and attacked before the little bit of sunlight had gone. Since the Abomination had cut off the world from heaven, the daylight hours were becoming shorter, the darkness falling earlier and earlier all around the world. Having confronted creatures like the Oni before, he knew that they disliked the daylight and would likely remain beneath the bridge while the sun was shining.<br> <br>The trolls had been like sitting ducks, huddled together in a filthy group of fur and fang. Aaron remembered a time, not too long ago, when launching an attack on an unsuspecting enemy would have bothered him, would have made him think that he was somehow being unfair.<br> <br>But that was before he&#x2019;d started to bury his friends, and seen these nightmarish monsters feed upon the remains of the dead.<br> <br>&#x201c;Unmerciful&#x201d; would probably be the best word to define him these days, and he found that very sad.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;Are you all right, Aaron?&#x201d;</i> Gabriel asked, coming in very close to sniff his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, boy.&#x201d; Aaron reached out to pet his dog&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Just a little tired.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a wonder that you&#x2019;re still able to function at all,&#x201d; Vilma said, getting beneath one of his arms and helping Aaron to stand. &#x201c;How much sleep have you had in the last few days? Be honest with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vilma steered him over to where Kraus was finishing up with Cameron.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not much,&#x201d; he answered, wincing in pain as he sat in one of the old wooden chairs that had been left behind when the school had been abandoned.<br> <br>Vilma stepped back, and Kraus went to work.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remove your shirt,&#x201d; he told Aaron in a no-nonsense tone.<br> <br>Aaron tried, but he just couldn&#x2019;t seem to get the shirt up over his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;For Heaven&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Vilma said, rushing over to help him pull the bloody T-shirt from his body.<br> <br>&#x201c;No amount of washing is going to ever get this clean again,&#x201d; she said, tossing the filthy garment to the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Aaron said without much conviction. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of my best shirts.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gabriel sniffed at the filthy pile of cloth, and the hackles on his golden back rose like quills.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;Trolls,&#x201d;</i> the Labrador said in the language of his breed. <i>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like trolls at all.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>&#x201c;The Oni aren&#x2019;t very likeable,&#x201d; Aaron confirmed as Kraus worked, cleaning up various bites and scratches.<br> <br>Considering the level of combat he&#x2019;d encountered, Aaron was surprised that he hadn&#x2019;t sustained more damage. He&#x2019;d gone right at the Oni nest beneath the bridge, attacking with a sword of heavenly fire. The Oni hadn&#x2019;t cared for that in the least. Many had risked the pain of daylight to crawl from their hiding places and confront him.<br> <br>He remembered the stink of their fur as they&#x2019;d burned with the touch of his sword and the rays of the sun, and felt himself grow nauseous. The air had become saturated with the smell as he&#x2019;d fought wave after wave of the snarling things. Beneath the suspension bridge Aaron had found the remains of people who had tried to cross, stored for later consumption in thick weblike cocoons created with Oni saliva. It was a horrible sight, and one that he doubted he would ever forget.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d used that memory, that horrible, disturbing memory, as he&#x2019;d fought the trolls that had been responsible for such heinous acts against other living creatures, killing one after another until they were all dead.<br> <br>Aaron leaned back against the chair now. His eyes were heavy with exhaustion, and he felt his head begin to nod, only to snap back up just as sleep was about to claim him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is he all right, Kraus?&#x201d; Vilma asked the healer as she reached out to steady Aaron.<br> <br>&#x201c;Unless there are internal injuries that I&#x2019;m unaware of, he should be fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hear that? I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Aaron said, his eyes fluttering as he tried to stay awake. He glanced over to see Melissa and Cameron watching him, concern in their eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you two okay?&#x201d; he asked them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Melissa said, holding up her bandaged hand. &#x201c;I can feel it healing already.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay too,&#x201d; Cameron said, touching the bandage on his cheek. &#x201c;Besides, girls love scars; they add character.&#x201d; He laughed as Melissa punched him.<br> <br>Aaron felt a pressure under his arm and looked up as Vilma pulled him up from the chair and began to lead him from the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d; he asked, trying to halt his progress.<br> <br>&#x201c;You need a shower, and some sleep,&#x201d; Vilma replied.<br> <br>On the big-screen television behind him he heard the report of a city in Ukraine being besieged by what looked to be giant bats. He planted his feet to hear the rest of the news coverage.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Vilma said firmly, pulling him around to face her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Melissa and Cameron are hurt. They aren&#x2019;t in any condition to go. I&#x2014;&#x201d; he started to explain.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not going anywhere either,&#x201d; she interrupted, loud enough so they all could hear. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re running ourselves ragged, and it&#x2019;s not going to do anybody any good at all if we&#x2019;re making mistakes. Mistakes could get us killed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gabriel stood beside her, his tail tucked and his head bowed in submission. <i>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right, Aaron.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>Aaron was going to argue, but deep down he knew that they <i>were</i> right.<br> <br>&#x201c;We all need to rest&#x2014;to heal.&#x201d; Vilma looked around the room again, certain to make eye contact with Cameron and Melissa.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Aaron said, giving in. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll rest.&#x201d; Really, he was too damn tired to fight anyway. &#x201c;Two hours. Then you wake me up. Deal?&#x201d;<br> <br>Vilma moved in close to him again, ushering him from the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shower first. You stink like death,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Then two hours of uninterrupted sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You drive a hard bargain, Ms. Santiago.&#x201d; Aaron surrendered as the reports of even more horrors droned from the television in the other room.<br> <br><i>Two hours. And then back to work.</i><br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Vilma waited until Aaron was finished with his shower, and then escorted him to bed.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d done exactly what she&#x2019;d thought he would, telling her that he was feeling much better and much more awake, and that he could take care of those bats and be back for a rest in no time.<br> <br>Vilma didn&#x2019;t even feel it necessary to respond. She and Gabriel escorted Aaron, wrapped in a towel, from the shower room to the bedroom they shared.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sleep,&#x201d; she commanded, pointing to the mattress.<br> <br>He looked like he was about to argue, and then thought better of it. <i>Smart boy</i>.<br> <br>Aaron stumbled across the room like the Corpse Riders they&#x2019;d encountered not long ago. At least he now smelled better.<br> <br>He fell onto the mattress, and barely had the sheet and comforter over him before he was asleep.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;Do you think he&#x2019;ll stay there if we leave?&#x201d;</i> Gabriel asked Vilma.<br> <br>&#x201c;You could stand guard if you want, but I think he&#x2019;s down for the count.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>&#x201c;And how about you?&#x201d;</i> the dog asked her.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about me?&#x201d; she questioned, heading back to the TV room, where they&#x2019;d left the others. She wanted to be sure that Melissa and Cameron were listening to her orders.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve taken on more responsibility as second in command, and you haven&#x2019;t been sleeping all that much either,&#x201d;</i> Gabriel reminded her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need that much sleep,&#x201d; she lied. &#x201c;Never have. I was always the early riser in my family.&#x201d;<br> <br>Which wasn&#x2019;t a lie, but it had had more to do with her studies in school. Those days seemed so very long ago now. She couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time she&#x2019;d even looked at a book.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;You look tired,&#x201d;</i> Gabriel said, looking up at her as they walked.<br> <br>Vilma stopped, and squatted down to his level.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; She scratched him behind one of his golden yellow ears. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that things are a little intense around here.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>&#x201c;I worry about you,&#x201d;</i> Gabriel said, and licked her hand. <i>&#x201c;I worry about all of you.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>She smiled, leaning forward to kiss the top of his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good ole Gabriel,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to know that somebody is looking out for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>She stood then, knees cracking as she did.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;That didn&#x2019;t sound good,&#x201d;</i> Gabriel said.<br> <br>&#x201c;It felt even worse.&#x201d; Vilma laughed. &#x201c;Must be getting old.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was truth to what she said. Over the last few months she felt like she&#x2019;d aged physically, and mentally.<br> <br>She was sure that she wasn&#x2019;t supposed to feel this way at nineteen, but then again, most nineteen-year-olds weren&#x2019;t out killing beasts that seemed like they&#x2019;d crawled out of Stephen King&#x2019;s worst nightmare.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;Or maybe you&#x2019;re just not taking care of yourself the way you should,&#x201d;</i> the dog suggested as they walked down the hallway again. <i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to deny that there&#x2019;s some truth to what you&#x2019;re saying. Which is why I put Aaron to bed, and told the others to...&#x201d; Vilma trailed off as they entered the TV room and saw Melissa&#x2019;s wings emerge from her back. Cameron&#x2019;s wings were out too, and he was about to cloak his body with them to disappear, off to who knows where.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the hell do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d; Vilma asked, striding into the room.<br> <br>Kraus stood silently nearby, putting away his creams and salves.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had a breather,&#x201d; Cameron said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something going on at the Great Wall of China, and an ocean liner is under attack off the coast of Africa. We thought we&#x2019;d go and check things out before&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Vilma said.<br> <br>Cameron gave her a quizzical smile. &#x201c;What do you mean &#x2018;no&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What part of &#x2018;everyone needs a rest&#x2019; didn&#x2019;t you understand?&#x201d; she asked sternly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got it, but I thought you were just saying that to get Aaron to lie down for a while,&#x201d; Cameron explained. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re fine,&#x201d; he said, looking at Melissa, who nodded in agreement. &#x201c;We can handle a few more situations before we crash.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I said no,&#x201d; Vilma said with even more forcefulness.<br> <br>Anger suddenly showed upon Cameron&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t just do nothing,&#x201d; the younger Nephilim said. &#x201c;There are people dying all over the world in ways too horrible to even think about,&#x201d; he said, gesturing to the television screen that was reporting on some other bizarre and potentially fatal incident.<br> <br>&#x201c;We <i>can</i> do nothing,&#x201d; she said, snatching up the remote from one of the chairs and turning off the broadcast. &#x201c;We <i>have</i> to do nothing,&#x201d; she stressed. &#x201c;For a little while. Just until we&#x2019;ve recharged.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But people are dying,&#x201d; Melissa argued.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think I know that?&#x201d; Vilma snapped. &#x201c;But I also know that we&#x2019;ve been going nonstop, traveling all over the world, dealing with one emerging threat after another, saving lives, but we&#x2019;re killing ourselves.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cameron was about to argue, but Vilma silenced him with a stare.<br> <br>&#x201c;As far as we know we&#x2019;re the only ones of our kind capable of dealing with these threats.

We&#x2019;ll be less likely to make mistakes&#x2014;and more likely to survive our battles.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vilma paused, the realization of what she was about to say taking quite a bit from her.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t save everybody,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;re going to be able to help even fewer peopl...</p><h2>Dog Man: Fetch-22: From the Creator of Captain Underpants (Dog Man #8)</h2><p>Petey the Cat is out of jail, and he has a brand-new lease on life.

This is the story Jodi Melamed tells in <i>Represent and Destroy</i>, portraying the postwar racial break as a transition from white supremacist modernity to a formally antiracist liberal capitalist modernity in which racial violence works normatively by policing representations of difference. </p><p>Following the institutionalization of literature as a privileged domain for Americans to get to know difference&#x2014;to describe, teach, and situate themselves with respect to race&#x2014;Melamed focuses on literary studies as a cultural technology for transmitting liberal racial orders. She examines official antiracism in the United States and finds that these were key to ratifying the country&#x2019;s global ascendancy. She shows how racial liberalism, liberal multiculturalism, and neoliberal multiculturalism made racism appear to be disappearing, even as they incorporated the assumptions of global capitalism into accepted notions of racial equality. </p><p>Yet <i>Represent and Destroy</i> also recovers an anticapitalist &#x201c;race radical&#x201d; tradition that provides a materialist opposition to official antiracisms in the postwar United States&#x2014;a literature that sounds out the violence of liberal racial orders, relinks racial inequality to material conditions, and compels desire for something better than U.S. multiculturalism.<br></p></p><p><p>Jodi Melamed is assistant professor of English and Africana Studies at Marquette University. </p><p>"A brilliant correction to both Weber and Winant, <i>Represent and Destroy </i>demonstrates how &#x2018;the control over the means of rationality&#x2019; characterizes post-World War II US liberal racial orders. Working against the grain of change-as-progress, Jodi Melamed painstakingly demonstrates how official anti-racism has steadied, rather than dissolved, race as a structuring force of capitalism." &#x2014;Ruth Wilson Gilmore, author of <i>Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis and Opposition in Globalizing California</i></p></p><h2>The Validation Breakthrough: Simple Techniques for Communicating with People with Alzheimer&#39;s and Other Dementias</h2><p>Validation is a practical way of communicating with and managing problem behavior in older adults with Alzheimer&#39;s-type dementia.

In the course of exploring the human pilgrimage on Earth, Dante charts a vivid path through the canticles of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven in his legendary poem. Robert Royal presents a careful but reader-friendly approach to the poetry of the texts themselves and a biographical sketch of Dante, the man, the writer, and the spiritual lover extraordinaire.</p><p>Robert Royal is the author of The Catholic Martyrs of the Twentieth Century and Dante Alighieri. He is editor in chief of The Catholic Thing, an online publication he founded with Michael Novak; the president of the Faith and Reason Institute, based in Washington, DC; the graduate dean of Catholic Distance University; and a member of the board of directors of the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute. He has taught at Brown University, Rhode Island College, and the Catholic University of America. He lives in Washington, DC.</p><h2>Salvation Outside the Church: Tracing the History of the Catholic Response</h2><p>When in 1949 Fr. Leonard Feeney, SJ accused the Archbishop of Boston, Richard J. Cushing, of heresy for holding that Jews and Protestants could be saved, he backed up his charge by producing passages from the writings of fathers of the church such as St. Augustine, of eminent theologians such as St. Thomas Aquinas, and from the decrees of popes and councils, to prove that it was a dogma of faith that there is no salvation outside the Catholic Church. He did seem to have the weight of evidence on his side, and it was not easy to see how the modern idea that non-Catholics can be saved could be reconciled with the church&#39;s traditional doctrine that excluded them from salvation. Many in the Catholic Church have felt that while Feeney must surely have been wrong, the questions he raised were never satisfactorily answered. Is it really a dogma of Catholic faith that there is no salvation outside the church? Can the optimism of Vatican II about the universal possibility of salvation be defended as an example of homogeneous development of doctrine? Or would it be more honest to say that the Catholic Church has recognized that its previous teaching was mistaken? The author is convinced that the only way to answer such questions is by a thorough study of the history of Christian thought about the salvation of those &#34;outside the church&#34; Rev. Sullivan makes this historical study a lively reading experience while drawing conclusions that will impact ecumenical thinking for years to come.</p><p>Rev. Francis A. Sullivan, S.J. taught ecclesiology at the Gregorian University in Rome for 35 years until 1993. Since then he has taught in the Theology Department at Boston College. His other books include &#39;Creative Fidelity&#39;, &#39;Charisms and Charismatic Renewal&#39;, &#39;The Church We Believe In&#39; (Paulist Press), and &#39;From Apostles to Bishops&#39; (Paulist Press).Sullivan traces the history of the teaching that "outside the Church there is no salvation" from Justin Martyr (second century) to the present. Sullivan is sensitive not only to the verbal formula but to its interpretation. The shift from a narrow and pessimistic view of the possibility of salvation, a view limiting salvation to some in communion with the church, to an open and optimistic view which stresses God's universal redemptive will has important ramifications for ecumenical Christian and interfaith dialog, as well as for Christology itself. Sullivan makes these issues clear.

Dr. Kuiper, who died in 1966, was for many decades a teacher of theology, and his great concern was for the popular presentation of Christian doctrine. His own books went far to meet that need, including his God-Centered Evangelism (also published by the Trust) and For Whom Did Christ Die? on the extent of the atonement. In addition to his vigorous and clear style, Kuiper is also noted for the comprehensive way in which he treats his subject. The Glorious Body contains no less than fifty-three chapters, and among the aspects of the subject dealt with are unity, the marks of the Church, the offices of the Church, its responsibilities and privileges, and the Church and the world. Although this book is worthy of the widest possible circulation, it may be particularly commended as a manual for office-bearers in the Church.</p><p></p><h2>Rain on the Dead (Sean Dillon)</h2><p><b><b><b><b>The past comes back to haunt black ops specialist Sean Dillon and his colleagues in this <i>New York Time</i>s bestselling novel of terrorism, revenge, and a very old nemesis...</b><br></b><br></b></b>On a dark summer night, two Chechen mercenaries emerge from the waters off Nantucket to kill a high-value target, the former President of the United States. Unfortunately for them, the president has guests that night, including Sean Dillon and his colleague, Afghan war hero Captain Sara Gideon.<br><br>The Chechens do not survive the night, but Dillon is curious about how they even got on the island. What he discovers sends a chill through his bones&#x2014;a name from Dillon&#x2019;s distant past. If this man is working with the terrorists now, the assassination attempt is only the beginning&#x2014;and next time, the results may be much, much different.</p><p><b>Jack Higgins</b>&nbsp;lives on Jersey in the Channel Islands. The author of dozens of bestsellers, most famously&nbsp;<i>The Eagle Has Landed</i>, he served three years with the Royal Horse Guards in Eastern Europe during the Cold War, and subsequently was a circus roustabout, a factory worker, a truck driver, and a laborer before entering college at age 27. He holds degrees in sociology, social psychology, and economics, and a doctorate in media. A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, he is an expert scuba diver and marksman.The island of Nantucket, Massachusetts&#x2014;high summer, the western end of the harbor crowded with boats, many tied up at the jetty. Among them was a scarlet-and-white sportfisherman named Dolphin. On the flying bridge, a gray-haired man sat at the wheel playing a clarinet, something plaintive and touching. He was around sixty, a white curling beard giving him the look of an old sailor.<p>The man who joined him from below, wearing swimming trunks, had dark tousled hair and the beard of some medieval bravo. He was fit and muscular, his smile pleasant enough, his only unusual feature two scars on his left chest which any doctor would have recognized as relics from old bullet wounds.</p><p>He spoke in Irish. &#x201c;Big night, Kelly!&#x201d;</p><p>The other answered in the same. &#x201c;You could say that. It&#x2019;ll be dark soon, Tod&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re going to grab that swim, it&#x2019;d better be now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will. Keep your eye out for that kid, Henry, from the harbormaster&#x2019;s office. He&#x2019;s bringing our passports and the credit card, so don&#x2019;t forget to speak like the Yank your passport says you are.&#x201d;</p><p>He slid down the ladder, vaulted over the rail, and swam away. Kelly heard a call from the dock.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Jackson, are you there?&#x201d;</p><p>Kelly descended the ladder. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s having a swim. I&#x2019;m his partner, Jeremy Hawkins.&#x201d;</p><p>Henry handed over the two passports. &#x201c;There you go, sir, Mr. Jackson&#x2019;s credit card is in the envelope and your mooring license covers you until Friday.&#x201d;</p><p>Kelly took the package. &#x201c;Thanks, son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great clarinet I just heard. Kind of sounds like Gershwin, though I don&#x2019;t recognize the tune.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an Irish folk song called &#x2018;The Lark in the Clear Air.&#x2019; And you&#x2019;re right, I did put a bit of Gershwin in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think he would have been pleased, sir. Are you and your friend professional musicians?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was for a while and he does play decent piano, but on the whole, we found other things kept getting in the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that seems like a damn shame to me,&#x201d; Henry said, and walked away, calling at another boat.</p><p>Kelly turned and looked out over the harbor to see how Tod was getting on, and saw him swimming toward a round buoy floating on a chain. Many people were diving or jumping off the boats, some in wet suits, generally having a good time while the light still held.</p><p>For his part, Tod stroked the last couple of yards, then grabbed onto the chain, aware of the unmistakable sound of a helicopter descending somewhere in the distance.</p><p>He hung there, listening, and two young men erupted from the water, like black seals in their wet suits. They were like twins, darkly handsome, the same wildness apparent in their faces.</p><p>The nearest one grabbed the chain and laughed as his brother joined them. &#x201c;Mr. Jackson, I recognize you from your photo. We&#x2019;re the ones you came to meet. The Master sends his regards and hopes that success in our venture will make us your favorite Chechens. I&#x2019;m Yanni and this is Khalid.&#x201d;</p><p>He had no accent, which his brother explained in a rather mocking tone. &#x201c;Our parents were killed by barbaric Russian soldiers in the Chechen war. The wonderful American Red Cross saved us and our grandparents, and gave us a new life in good old New York.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where thanks to the public school system, we emerged as normal American teenagers,&#x201d; Yanni said.</p><p>&#x201c;Creating a problem for Westerners who expect Muslims to look and sound like Arabs,&#x201d; Khalid said.</p><p>&#x201c;So what can Muslims who look like Westerners do?&#x201d; Yanni added.</p><p>&#x201c;Why, serve Allah as undercover warriors in the great struggle,&#x201d; his brother said. &#x201c;And here we are. We&#x2019;ve already checked out the house of our target. It&#x2019;s just off the beach, surrounded by trees, no problem. An easy one, this.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod said, &#x201c;Except that every security camera on every property you passed walking along that beach probably has your faces now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;ll wear ski masks for the hit,&#x201d; Khalid said. &#x201c;Why should it matter as long as the target is dead? That&#x2019;s all that counts.&#x201d;</p><p>They were no longer smiling. Their faces were like death masks, their eyes pinpricks. They were obviously on drugs, which exasperated Tod, though there was no point in mentioning it now.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going back to that boat.&#x201d; He indicated the Dolphin.&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you there in forty-five minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>They didn&#x2019;t reply, simply turned and swam away, and so did he.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Hawkins was Tim Kelly, and Jackson, Tod Flynn, both of them Provisional IRA who had served sentences in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland for many killings. Released during the peace process, they had become mercenaries. The situations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and elsewhere offered highly paid security work and sometimes rather more than that, for Flynn had been a top enforcer with the IRA, and reputation was everything in the Death Trade. It brought the cautious phone calls, the offers of the big money that went with them, and the offer for this present job had been very big.</p><p>In the cabin belowdecks, he had a large whiskey, feeling strangely cold, and told Kelly about his meeting with the Chechens. Kelly said, &#x201c;I knew it was a mistake to get involved with sodding Muslims. What are we going to do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much we can do, but I&#x2019;ll tell you this. I&#x2019;m putting a pistol in my pocket for when they come, just in case it gets nasty. You should, too,&#x201d; and he hurried away to his cabin.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>He showered and dressed, and as he did so, remembered the first time he&#x2019;d heard the Master&#x2019;s voice, filled with quiet authority, and a touch of English upper class.</p><p>&#x201c;Would that be Mr. Tod Flynn?&#x201d; the voice had asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Who wants to know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just credited your bank account with a hundred thousand dollars. Check for yourself, and I&#x2019;ll be back in fifteen minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod frowned, but called his bank and received the happy news that the money had indeed been deposited from a Swiss bank in Geneva.</p><p>When the second call came, he said instantly, &#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;People know me as the Master. That will do for the moment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Al-Qaeda,&#x201d; Tod said. &#x201c;Everyone in the business knows about you guys and the way you operate. Don&#x2019;t you have enough of your own people to call on? What do you want me for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m a great admirer. That finance man in Nigeria you took care of&#x2014;five hundred yards through an open window of a car doing seventy. Splendid work. I have a list. My favorite was the Russian paratroop general who glanced out of the turret of his tank for a moment during a street battle and you took him at five hundred yards.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Four hundred,&#x201d; Tod said. &#x201c;And it was snowing. So what do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have a target, living quietly in a house on the island of Nantucket with a manservant. I&#x2019;m sending in a couple of Chechen boys to knock him off. All I need from you is to keep an eye on things and pick them up when they&#x2019;re done. You&#x2019;ll be waiting in a boat off the beach and they&#x2019;ll swim out to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m the getaway driver, is that it?&#x201d; Tod laughed harshly. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he done, this target?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No need for you to know. Let&#x2019;s just say he&#x2019;s an old enemy.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod nodded. &#x201c;And what would be in it for me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve already got one hundred thousand. That&#x2019;s for you and your friend Kelly. I&#x2019;ll give you another hundred afterward and take care of your expenses.&#x201d;</p><p>As usual, greed won the day. &#x201c;Add another fifty thousand,&#x201d; Tod said. &#x201c;Which rounds it to a quarter of a million, and I expect the full advance before we go.&#x201d;</p><p>The man who called himself the Master paused, then said, &#x201c;Agreed.&#x201d;</p><p>And Tod, some part of him already regretting it, said, &#x201c;Done. When do we meet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That will never happen, my friend. You&#x2019;ll have to be content with my voice on the phone. I&#x2019;ll send you a coded mobile with the tickets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Tim Kelly was shocked when Tod told him about the call. &#x201c;Holy Mary, do we have to get involved with a bunch of Muslims like al-Qaeda?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll dance a jig when that money turns up in your bank account,&#x201d; Tod said. Later, he did wonder why the Master wanted him at all. The mystery man had made all the arrangements and the plan itself was simple enough. It was the height of tourist season, and the two assassins would be just another couple of people strolling along by night, carrying beach bags that would contain a couple of silenced Glocks, more than adequate to handle the situation. When they were done, they could just walk away from the scene of silent slaughter, which wouldn&#x2019;t be discovered until morning, long after they had swum out to sea, each with a phosphorescent signaling ball held in his palm to guide in the waiting Dolphin.</p><p>It seemed too simple, and Tod couldn&#x2019;t think why, still couldn&#x2019;t as he finished dressing now, and then he heard a disturbance above. He hurried through the cabin, went on deck, and found Kelly switching on all the lights against the hurrying dark. The Chechens were there.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Tod demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;These two bastards are cracked, if you ask me,&#x201d; Kelly said. &#x201c;They were sharing a bottle as they came along the jetty. That young guy from the harbormaster&#x2019;s office remonstrated with them as they were boarding.&#x201d; He pointed at Khalid. &#x201c;This one told him to fuck off.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod grabbed Khalid by the front of his shirt. &#x201c;Stupid bastard, are you crazy? That kind of trouble is the last thing we need.&#x201d;</p><p>Yanni reached in his beach bag and produced a silenced Glock. &#x201c;Touch my brother again and I&#x2019;ll kill you.&#x201d;</p><p>Kelly, standing behind them, drew a Walther, but Tod released Khalid, laughing harshly. &#x201c;Go on, do it. Kill both of us, why don&#x2019;t you? Then tell me who&#x2019;s going to wait off that beach to pick you up.&#x201d;</p><p>Yanni put the Glock away and smiled falsely. &#x201c;Hey, can&#x2019;t you take a joke, Mr. Jackson? Khalid was having a laugh. Like boxers going in the ring for a big fight. You get kind of nervous waiting for the action.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then I suggest you go, find the action, and get on with it, and we&#x2019;ll get on with our part of the job.&#x201d;</p><p>Yanni laughed out loud. &#x201c;You know something, you&#x2019;re a real funny man, Mr. Jackson. I like you, I really do . . .&#x201d;</p><p>He gave his brother a push and they scrambled up onto the jetty. Khalid took a bottle from his pocket, held it up, then tossed it into the harbor. &#x201c;Just kidding, Mr. Jackson,&#x201d; he said, and they walked away.</p><p>&#x201c;Total fruitcakes,&#x201d; Kelly said in disgust. &#x201c;Where the hell did this Master find them? Don&#x2019;t tell me he didn&#x2019;t know they had problems.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind that for now. We&#x2019;ve got half an hour to spare before we have to cast off and go round the coast to wait for them. I could do with coffee and a sandwich,&#x201d; Todd said.</p><p>He led the way below, and as they reached the kitchen area, the coded mobile phone the Master had given him trembled. He took it out and switched it to speaker. He turned to Kelly, touched a finger to his lips and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Flynn, I&#x2019;m afraid something&#x2019;s come up that affects our plans,&#x201d; the voice said.</p><p>&#x201c;And what would that be?&#x201d; Tod demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just heard from a source that the target is receiving guests tonight by helicopter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We heard one arriving somewhere in the island not long ago,&#x201d; Tod told him.</p><p>The Master&#x2019;s voice was unemotional. &#x201c;Probably the one delivering them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll get a shock when they find themselves invaded by two crazy Chechens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Chechens we need to worry about,&#x201d; the Master said. &#x201c;His guests are General Charles Ferguson, who commands the British Prime Minister&#x2019;s private hit squad, and he has two of his top people with him. A Captain Sara Gideon and one Sean Dillon, a notorious IRA gunman who now works for Ferguson.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I know these people, everyone in the Death Trade does.&#x201d; Flynn was angry now. &#x201c;Why the hell would they be here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to tell you who our target is. It&#x2019;s the former president of the United States, Jake Cazalet.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod was shocked. &#x201c;You lousy bastard.&#x201d;</p><p>The Master continued. &#x201c;You must cancel the operation. I can&#x2019;t do it. Yanni and Khalid have no phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Tod said. &#x201c;You knew they were wild cards and too untrustworthy to handle your special phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You must try and stop them. Surely there&#x2019;s still time?&#x201d;</p><p>Tod was so angry he switched off.</p><p>Kelly said, &#x201c;Christ, what a cock-up. Maybe we&#x2019;ll be lucky and catch them walking the beach to Cazalet&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, we won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Tod told him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want anything more to do with this. We&#x2019;ll cast off right now, sail overnight to Long Island, and leave the boat at Quogue. Then we&#x2019;ll head straight to the airport and find the first plane that&#x2019;ll take us back to Dublin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And not even try to pick the boys up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really think there&#x2019;ll be anyone to pick up? Sean Dillon is a bloody living legend of the IRA, as no one knows better than you, and this Sara Gideon lass has a Military Cross for killing Taliban. Not to mention Ferguson himself. No, those Chechens are dead meat. And frankly, I couldn&#x2019;t care less.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The house stood in trees behind a vast beach reaching out from town. The helicopter had landed some distance away, where Cazalet&#x2019;s Secret Service man, Dalton, waited in a Jeep. He went to greet Ferguson and his people, who walked to meet him.</p><p>Ferguson shook hands. &#x201c;Here I am again, Agent Dalton. Nice to see you.&#x201d; They waited as the helicopter drifted away.</p><p>Dalton said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be back in the morning.&#x201d; He eased Sara&#x2019;s bag from her hand and led the way to the Jeep.</p><p>&#x201c;President Cazalet&#x2019;s really pleased to be seeing you. Mrs. Boulder has left out a lovely supper in the conservatory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The President? Is that how you still address him?&#x201d; Sara asked.</p><p>Ferguson said, &#x201c;Technically, all former holders of the office retain the title for life, but I think it&#x2019;s a matter of individual choice. Cazalet says there can only be one Mr. President and asks that I call him Jake. I could never bring myself to do it, so I make do with &#x2018;sir.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then &#x2018;sir&#x2019; it will be for me also,&#x201d; Sara said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing Murchison again,&#x201d; Ferguson said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the dog of the house, Sara, a wonderful flat-coated retriever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who once saved the President&#x2019;s life, as I recall,&#x201d; Dillon said. &#x201c;Although there&#x2019;s no official documentation of that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Too bad he isn&#x2019;t here tonight,&#x201d; said Dalton. &#x201c;Mrs. Boulder has taken him home with her. She gets lonely since her husband died last year, and the President doesn&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned off the road at a point where high-wire fencing fronted the trees. He paused, waiting for a ten-foot gate to open slowly between stone pillars, and drove through, pine trees and lots of shrubbery crowding in from both sides. To the left, they could see a terraced conservatory and they continued, circling around to a formal garden that fronted the old Colonial-style house with steps leading up to a pillared entrance, the door standing open, light pouring out, and Jake Cazalet waiting to greet them.</p><p>&#x201c;Charles, my dear old friend,&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;Marvelous to see you, marvelous to see all of you.&#x201d;</p><p>Then he rushed down the steps to greet them, arms outstretched.</p><p>After embraces, Ferguson said, &#x201c;Now, this was all most mysterious. It&#x2019;s always a pleasure to see you, sir, but why were we summoned?&#x201d;</p><p>Cazalet said, &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s nothing dire. The President wanted to invite you to the Oval Office, but couldn&#x2019;t because of th...</p></p><h2>Bootleggers, Lobstermen &amp; Lumberjacks</h2><p><i><b>Bootleggers, Lobstermen, and Lumberjacks!</b></i>The story of New England is built on an endless armature of&nbsp;fascinating stories of Yankee ingenuity and hardy, intrepid characters. <i><b>Bootleggers, Lobstermen, and Lumberjacks</b></i> presents the top 50 wildest episodes in the region's history in one convenient, narrative-driven package.</p><p>The story of New England is built on an endless armature of&nbsp;fascinating tales of Yankee ingenuity and intrepid characters, and <b><i>Bootleggers, Lobstermen &amp; Lumberjacks</i></b> brings together the top 50 wildest among them--shipwreck victims surviving any way they could; Indian, pirate, and shark attacks; cougar and bear attacks; and, of course, rum runners and bootleggers doing what they do best.

Acclaimed sociologist Christian Smith argues that this approach is misguided and unable to live up to its own claims. If evangelical biblicism worked as its proponents say it should, there would not be the vast variety of interpretive differences that biblicists themselves reach when they actually read and interpret the Bible. Far from challenging the inspiration and authority of Scripture, Smith critiques a particular rendering of it, encouraging evangelicals to seek a more responsible, coherent, and defensible approach to biblical authority.<br><br>This important book has generated lively discussion and debate. The paperback edition adds a new chapter responding to the conversation that the cloth edition has sparked.</p><p>"Evangelicalism is cracking apart not because of theological drift to the left but because the only theology that can sustain a genuine evangelicalism is--to use the only word appropriate--a catholic theology. Many who were nurtured in American evangelicalism (as Christian Smith was) and now find it seriously deficient (as Christian Smith does) seem to be those on whom the light has dawned. Here is a genuinely evangelical catholic understanding of scripture."<br>--<b>Scot McKnight</b>, Northern Seminary<br><br>"Biblicism remains one of the most entrenched and pressing problems facing the church. In his characteristically lucid, direct, and fair-minded fashion, Christian Smith asks questions about biblicism that need to be answered. Smith also begins to articulate an alternative, Christ-centered approach to biblical interpretation that is supremely constructive--a truly evangelical account of scripture."<br>--<b>Douglas A. Campbell</b>, Duke University Divinity School<br><br>"Given the importance and influence of evangelicalism in American religion and culture, this book is both a healthy corrective and a hopeful sign of positive developments within evangelicalism."<br>--<b>Daniel J. Harrington, SJ</b>, <i>America<br></i><br>"Ever the sociologist, Smith forces readers to confront and account for the stubborn fact that not everyone who ascribes supreme authority to 'what the Bible says' hears God saying the same thing. Even those, like me, who are not persuaded by his 'truly evangelical' alternative will benefit from this strong dose of realism about the way in which evangelicals actually interpret and appeal to the Bible."<br>--<b>Kevin J. Vanhoozer</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"[A] finely constructed volume. . . . Smith makes a persuasive case for shifting one's focus from the sole authority of the words of scripture to the one whom scripture proclaims to be 'the way, the truth and the life.' Such a shift, he insists, is necessary for American evangelicalism to move forward."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly<br><br></i>This edition includes a new afterword in which the author engages conversations stimulated by the hardcover edition."Many books have been written either defending or detracting from an evangelical view of the Bible. Christian Smith, as a trained sociologist, offers a much-needed perspective: explaining evangelical biblicism as a sociological phenomenon. Smith demonstrates, respectfully but critically, that the type of biblicism that often characterizes evangelicalism cannot account for how scripture itself behaves. Biblicism is retained, however, because of its sociological value for 'maintaining safe identity boundaries.' Smith's analysis of the problem of biblicism and his offer of a way forward are important contributions to the current developments surrounding evangelicalism and the Bible."--<b>Peter Enns</b>, author, <i>Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament<br></i><br>"Christian Smith plainly says what so many others have been thinking or implying for some time--namely, that many strands of evangelicalism believe things about the Bible and theology that are simply <i>impossible</i>. Smith exposes the scholastic alchemy that holds this fragile theological edifice together and helps us understand that serious damage is done to the church and its witness when we perpetuate the errors of biblicism."--<b>Kenton L. Sparks</b>, Eastern University<br><br>"Smith vigorously presents a compelling possibility: The Bible could be more alive, the church could be more unified, those of us who care deeply about scripture could be less fearful about some collapse of authority and more honest about what is actually in the Bible if we simply began to listen with more humility and openness to what it is God seems most concerned to reveal.

The Congo had no intention of allowing the renegade region to secede, and neither did the CIA, the KGB, or the UN. The UN fielded soldiers from 20 nations, America paid the bills, and the Soviets intrigued behind the scenes. Yet to everyone&#x2019;s surprise the new nation&#x2019;s rag-tag army of local gendarmes, jungle tribesmen, and, controversially, European mercenaries, refused to give in. For two and a half years Katanga, the scrawniest underdog ever to fight a war, held off the world with guerrilla warfare, two-faced diplomacy, and some shady financial backing.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Christopher Othen </b>is a journalist, legal representative for asylum seekers, and English language teacher.

An introduction to the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece.</p><p>No education is complete without a large slice of Greek mythology. And there's no better way of meeting that literary quota than with the D'Aulaires' book. All the great gods and goddesses of ancient Greece are depicted in this big, beautiful classic, lovingly illustrated and skillfully told. Young readers will be dazzled by mighty Zeus, lord of the universe; stirred by elegant Athena, goddess of wisdom; intimidated by powerful Hera, queen of Olympus; and chilled by moody Poseidon, ruler of the sea. These often impetuous immortals flounce and frolic, get indiscreet, and get even. From petty squabbles to heroic deeds, their actions cover the range of godly--and mortal--personalities.<p> The D'Aulaires' illustrations have a memorable quality: once pored over, they will never leave the minds of the viewer. Decades later, the name Gaea will still evoke the soft green picture of lovely Mother Earth, her body hills and valleys and her eyes blue lakes reflecting the stars of her husband, Uranus the sky. No child is too young to appreciate the myths that have built the foundation for much of the world's art and literature over the centuries. This introduction to mythology is a treasure.

His comic inventiveness and mind-bending talent prompted <b>Time</b> magazine to proclaim him a "psychedelic Nabokov for the cyber-age." In his third novel, <b>Buddha's Little Finger</b>, Pelevin has created an intellectually dazzling tale about identity and Russian history, as well as a spectacular elaboration of Buddhist philosophy. Moving between events of the Russian Civil War of 1919 and the thoughts of a man incarcerated in a contemporary Moscow psychiatric hospital, <b>Buddha's Little Finger</b> is a work of demonic absurdism by a writer who continues to delight and astonish.</p><p>At one point in the hallucinatory trip that is <i>Buddha's Little Finger</i>, the protagonist regains consciousness in a cold-water bath, with a large, naked man prodding him awake and cheerfully acknowledging that the situation "might seem quite unbearably loathsome. Inexpressibly, inhumanly monstrous and absurd. Entirely incompatible with life." That would be an understatement. Yet Victor Pelevin, who's already produced such post-perestroika gems as <i>Omon Ra</i> and <i>The Life of Insects</i>, gets plenty of comic mileage out of Pyotr Voyd's dilemma. He also puts identity, reality, and existence up for grabs, and toys with time and continuity much as Italo Calvino did in his exhilarating <i>If on a Winter's Night a Traveler</i>.<p> A poet from St. Petersburg, Pelevin's hero finds himself caught in a temporal tug of war: on one hand, he's walking a tightrope between Reds and Whites during the Russian Revolution, and on the other, he's floating in and out of the bizarre world of a psychiatric hospital in 1990s Moscow. The revolutionary era does offer Pyotr the occasional boost. His commander, the sly and intellectually provocative comrade Chapaev, tells him that he is a "man of decisive character and at the same time you have a subtle appreciation of the essential nature of events. People like you are in great demand."</p><p> That's not the sense he gets in the hospital, however, where he passes the time kneading lumps of Plasticene and sketching busts of Aristotle. Sharing a room and "turbo-Jungian" therapy sessions with three other nutters, Pyotr is all too easily submerged in their intricate fantasies. Sound complicated? Well, Pelevin offers up these parallel lives in such a kaleidoscopic jumble that it's sometimes easy to get lost. Yet those readers willing to follow the hero in his travails--to make, as it were, a leap into the Voyd--will encounter a hilarious, disturbing, and wildly inventive exploration of reality. <i>--S. Ketchum</i></p><b>Victor Pelevin</b> is the author of <b>A Werewolf Problem in Central Russia and Other Stories, The Life of Insects, Omon Ra, The Yellow Arrow</b>, and <b>The Blue Lantern</b>, a collection of short stories that won the Russian "Little Booker" Prize.

Whatever it is, odds are that you don&#x2019;t like doing it as much as the elephant in this book enjoys smashing small cars. He&#x2019;ll smash any small car that drives down his road. He smashes yellow cars, he smashes blue cars, he smashes red cars, all the while singing a special car-smashing song. Then one day a man comes to town and opens a small-car store right on the elephant&#x2019;s road. You can probably guess what the elephant does next, but the real fun starts when the man turns the tables on the elephant&#x2014;and his plan is a smashing success.&nbsp;<br><br> Jean Merrill&#x2019;s story of gleeful destruction, revenge, and conciliation is accompanied by Ronni Solbert&#x2019;s colorful crayon drawings.

Professor Kennedy lives in the United Kingdom.In forthrightly popular style, Kennedy fascinatingly chronicles the expansion of Islam from the death of the Prophet Mohammed in 632 to the beginning of the Abbasid Caliphate in 750 (the latter the subject of Kennedy&#39;s When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World, 2005). Relating the story, however, requires care since most sources date, as Kennedy cautions, from 150 to 250 years after the conquests they purport to describe. Kennedy&#39;s warnings engage interest as he provides the contexts of late antiquity, which lent advantage to the new religion sweeping out of Arabia. Crucially, Near East populations had been devastated by plague and by a war between Islam&#39;s political enemies: the Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire of Persia. Kennedy&#39;s attention to these factors deepens his interpretations of the Islamic chronicles, which he describes as frustratingly vague on details of battles but strangely attentive to the division of booty. Explaining the �lan that propelled Islam so far, so fast, and so permanently, Kennedy vividly introduces the formative establishment of Islam. Taylor, Gilbert</p><h2>Eug�ne Atget: Paris</h2><p><p>A fl�neur and photographer at once, Eug�ne Atget (1857&#x2013;1927) was obsessed with walking the streets. After trying his hand at painting and acting, the native of Libourne turned to photography and moved to Paris. He supplied studies for painters, architects, and stage designers, but became enraptured by what he called &#x201c;documents&#x201d; of the city and its environs. His scenes rarely included people, but rather the architecture, landscape, and artifacts that made up the societal and cultural stage.</p><p>Atget was not particularly renowned during his lifetime but in the 1920s came to the attention of the Dada and Surrealist avant-garde through Man Ray. Four of his images, with their particular fusion of mimesis and mystery, appeared in the surrealist journal, La R�volution Surr�aliste, while Ray and much of his artistic circle purchased Atget prints. Atget&#x2019;s fame grew after his death, with several articles and a monograph by Berenice Abbott. Several leading photographers, including Walker Evans and Bill Brandt, have since acknowledged their debt to Atget.</p><p>This fresh TASCHEN edition gathers some 500 photographs from the Atget archives at Mus�e Carnavalet and the Biblioth�que Historique de la Ville de Paris to celebrate his outstanding eye for the urban environment and evocation of a Paris gone by. Down main streets and side streets, past shops and churches, through courtyards and arcades and the 20 arrondissements, we find a unique portrait of a beloved city and the making of a modern photographic master.</p></p><p>Jean Claude Gautrand (1932&#x2013;2019) was one of France&#x2019;s most distinguished experts on photography. An active photographer since 1960, he also made a name for himself as a historian, journalist, and critic, with numerous publications including his TASCHEN books on Brassa� (2004), Paris.

Martin identified with the Abstract Expressionists but her commitment to linear geometry caused her to be associated in turn with Minimalist, feminist, and even outsider artists. She moved through some of the liveliest art communities of her time while maintaining a legendary reserve. &#x201c;I paint with my back to the world,&#x201d; she says both at the beginning and at the conclusion of a documentary filmed when she was in her late eighties. When she died at ninety-two, in Taos, New Mexico, it is said she had not read a newspaper in half a century.</p><p>Agnes Martin, the recipient of two career retrospectives as well as the National Medal of the Arts, was championed by critics as diverse in their approaches as Lucy Lippard, Lawrence Alloway, and Rosalind Krauss.

Princenthal has done a heroic service in scouting the glut of sources&#x2014;reviews, documentaries, interviews, previous publications&#x2014;for the brightest quotations and strangest anomalies. She strings these together into an engaging narrative. . . . [Her] tone is assured and reassuring. . . . Princenthal&#x2019;s book offers the frankest discussion to date of the artist&#x2019;s diagnosis [of schizophrenia]. It examines the shifting perception and treatment of mental illness in the US during Martin&#x2019;s lifetime, and also the rarity of her condition. &#x2014; Bookforum<br><br>Writing a biography of Agnes Martin is a study in frustration, but Princenthal manages to piece together a story while getting beyond her subject&#x2019;s well-guarded privacy. [She] carefully describes the artist&#x2019;s works, but there is no way to appreciate [Martin] without seeing the originals. The author&#x2019;s deep research and personal correspondence with the artist will be enlightening to fans of Martin and will encourage others to seek out her work. &#x2014; Kirkus Reviews<br><br>In the first comprehensive Martin biography, art critic Princenthal combines facts with astute critical analysis to create a richly inquisitive, vividly written portrait in sync with Martin&#x2019;s rigorous yet magnificently nuanced grid and stripe paintings. . . . Princenthal sensitively brings Martin forward as a strong, independent, courageous, thorny, self-mythologizing, funny, private, and generous artist of conviction and vision, who lived simply, attained wealth and fame, and experienced, at times, an 'ecstatic radiance' that will forever animate her paintings. &#x2014; Booklist/American Library Association, starred review<br><br>Princenthal&#x2019;s style is underplayed&#x2014;she, like her subject, never lends herself to theatricality. Also like Martin, Princenthal does a lot with very little. She smoothly transitions between art and life, lyricism and scholarship. . . . Martin is most famous for her minimal paintings, but Princenthal homes in on the lesser-known pockets of her career as well. Princenthal&#x2019;s book is thoughtful enough to feel personal...her words are in service of Martin&#x2019;s work and spirit. &#x2014; ARTnews<br><br>Superbly researched . . . offers the first comprehensive biography of Martin as well as a critical examination of the unusual body of work she produced during a professional career that lasted half a century. &#x2014; Hyperallergic<br><br>Rewarding. . . . [Princenthal] scrutinizes some two dozen works, tracks critical responses to Martin&#x2019;s art, and unpacks the artist&#x2019;s philosophical and religious sources. Fending off clich�s about madness and creativity, Princenthal draws a careful distinction between the schizophrenic&#x2019;s aural hallucinations and the artist&#x2019;s visions. &#x2014; New York Times Book Review<br><br>Doggedly researched and gracefully written. . . . [Princenthal] shines in describing Martin's earthy good humor and dedication to her art and in capturing the atmosphere in which the artist came of age.

Right from the beginning, Stead's emotional and detailed mixed-media illustrations inform readers what Vernon does not know-that Bird fell out of a cuckoo clock off a pickup truck before being found by Vernon while scavenging for useful odds and ends. Assuming that Bird is quiet because he's missing home, Vernon travels with him to search for his house. They find many different places that could make good homes for Bird-an old bird cage, a birdhouse, a nest, even a mailbox-but Bird remains quiet, making Vernon sad. A determined friend, Vernon continues searching until they find a pickup truck full of interesting things and a small blue house perfect for Bird, making him "cuckoo" with joy.

With the dramatic invention of a Father Mapple and the exquisite care of a Talmudic scholar, Wiesel interprets the wellsprings of Jewish religious tradition as the many faces of man&#x2019;s greatness facing the inexplicable. In an intimate relationship with God it is possible to complain, to demand. Adam and Eve in sinning &#x201c;cried out&#x201d; against the injustice of their entrapment; Cain assaulted God rather than his brother; and Abraham's agreement to sacrifice his son placed the burden of guilt on Him who demanded it. As for Job, Wiesel concludes that he abdicated his defiance as did the confessing Communists of Stalin&#x2019;s time to &#x2018;underline the implausibility&#x2019; of his trial, and thus become the accuser. Wiesel&#x2019;s concern with the imponderables of fate seems to move from strength to strength&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</p><p><b>Elie Wiesel</b> is the author of more than forty books, including his unforgettable international bestsellers <i>Night </i>and <i>A Beggar in Jerusalem</i>, winner of the Prix M�dicis.

This book may bring tears to your eyes." -- <i>San Francisco Chronicle&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>Journalist Jon Mooallem has watched his little daughter&#x2019;s world overflow with animals butterfly pajamas, appliqu�d owls&#x2014;while the actual world she&#x2019;s inheriting slides into a great storm of extinction. Half of all species could disappear by the end of the century, and scientists now concede that most of America&#x2019;s endangered animals will survive only if conservationists keep rigging the world around them in their favor. So Mooallem ventures into the field, often taking his daughter with him, to move beyond childlike fascination and make those creatures feel more real. <i>Wild Ones</i> is a tour through our environmental moment and the eccentric cultural history of people and wild animals in America that inflects it&#x2014;from Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s celebrations of early abundance to the turn-of the-last-century origins of the teddy bear to the whale-loving hippies of the 1970s. With propulsive curiosity and searing wit, and without the easy moralizing and nature worship of environmental journalism&#x2019;s older guard, <i>Wild Ones</i> merges reportage, science, and history into a humane and endearing meditation on what it means to live in, and bring a life into, a broken world.</p><p><b>Jon Mooallem</b> has been a contributing writer to <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>since 2006 and is a writer at large for <i>Pop-Up Magazine</i>, the live magazine in San Francisco.

He and his family live in San Francisco.<br><br> <b>www.JonMooallem.com</b>During the Cold War, a joint U.S.-Canadian military installation was built outside the tiny northern town of Churchill, Manitoba, at the western edge of Hudson Bay. Those stationed at Fort Churchill had several jobs to do, like be ready to repulse the Soviets if they invaded over the North Pole and figure out how to lob nuclear warheads at Moscow through the Aurora Borealis, which was proving, mysteriously, to muck up the guidance systems on their rockets. A lot of the soldiers&#x2019; time was also spent dealing with a nuisance: hundreds of polar bears that ambled across the tundra there every fall.<br>In November 1958, for example, one ate a pair of boots at the firing range. Another smashed a building&#x2019;s window, poked his head in, and had to be blasted with a fire extinguisher. At least twenty polar bears were loitering near the mess hall and the dump, and, late one Sunday night, three turned up at the central commissary. Soldiers in station wagons drove them back into the wilderness. One report noted, &#x201c;The most effective, anti-dawdling weapon has been the small helicopter.&#x201d; Even so, occasionally the bears would rear up on their hind legs and try to tussle with the armored flying machines. One helicopter pilot described how unsettling it was to make a low pass and find &#x201c;some six feet of indignant polar bear throwing haymakers&#x201d; with paws the size of dinner plates. After a while, military contractors limited the amount of work done outside at night; the higher-ups decided it would just be easier to stay out of the polar bears&#x2019; way. &#x201c;So this is civilization,&#x201d; began one newspaper article about military wives at Fort Churchill.<br><br>By the time I arrived, one November a half-century later, the military was gone. The fort had been dismantled and carted off, though two massive, ruined radar domes still sat in the distance like some post-apocalyptic Epcot attraction. A dozen specially built vehicles called Tundra Buggies crawled along the network of dirt roads the military had built and abandoned. Each was stuffed with tourists, many of whom had paid several thousand dollars a head to fly to Churchill, now billing itself as &#x201c;The Polar Bear Capital of the World.&#x201d; They were mostly older vacationers, taken out to the tundra every day to get a glimpse of the animals, then deposited back in town to prowl the gift shops along Churchill&#x2019;s main road, buying polar bear caps and snow hats, polar bear T-shirts, polar bear aprons, polar bear Christmas ornaments, polar bear magnets, polar bear boxer shorts, polar bear light-switch plates, polar bear wind chimes, polar bear baby bibs, and pajamas that say &#x201c;Bearly Awake.&#x201d;<br><br>A Tundra Buggy, if it resembles anything at all, resembles a double-wide school bus propped up on monster-truck tires. Three had pulled off the road to watch a lone polar bear splayed flat at the rim of a frozen pond, asleep in the willows. I was behind them in a scaled-down vehicle known as Buggy One, one of the storied, original rigs of the fleet. Buggy One is now operated by a conservation group, Polar Bears International. One of the group&#x2019;s videographers was shooting footage of the bear through an open window while the other staff on board tried to sit perfectly still so as not to rattle his tripod. The cameraman had been filming the bear for a long time, in Super HD, hoping it would stand up or do something alluring. Up ahead, tourists filed onto the rear decks of their buggies, training their Telephoto lenses and little point-and-shoots at the animal. It lifted its head once or twice, but that was it. After a couple of minutes, I noticed that the tourists had turned ninety degrees and were photographing us, aboard Buggy One, instead.<br><br>It was then that Martha Stewart&#x2019;s helicopter came into view. Everyone turned to watch it as it passed, flying low and very far ahead. Two hundred years ago, Arctic explorers described polar bears leaping out of the water and into boats, trying to &#x201c;resolutely seize and devour&#x201d; whichever dog or human being was sitting closest to their jaws, unprovoked and absolutely undeterred even if you tried to set the bear on fire. Now Martha Stewart had come to Churchill to shoot a special segment about the bears for her daytime television show on the Hallmark Channel.<br><br>Polar Bears International had been working in a loose partnership with Martha Stewart for many months in advance to handle logistics for her shoot. The group was trying to ensure that Martha told the right story about the animals. It isn&#x2019;t enough anymore to gush about how magnificent or cute polar bears are, as the many travel writers and television personalities that came to Churchill over the years had tended to. The stakes were too high now&#x2014;too urgent. Climate change had put the bear in severe jeopardy. According to a 2007 study by U.S. government scientists, two-thirds of the world&#x2019;s polar bears are likely to be gone by the middle of this century. And, of course, that&#x2019;s only one of many dispiriting prognoses trickling into the news these days. Another study predicts that climate change may wipe out one of every ten plant and animal species on the planet during that same time. Another claims seven of every ten could be gone. Tropical birds, butterflies, flying squirrels, coral reefs, koalas&#x2014;the new reality will rip away at all of them, and more. The projections range from bona fide tragedies to more niggling but genuinely disruptive bummers: tens of millions of people in Bangladesh are likely to be displaced by sea-level rise and flooding; the Forest Service warns of maple syrup shortages in America.<br><br>The polar bear, in other words, is an early indicator of all this other turmoil coming our way. It is, as everyone on Buggy One kept telling me, a &#x201c;canary in the coal mine&#x201d;&#x2014;that was the phrase they used, always, with unrelenting discipline. The animal had become a symbol for some otherwise inexpressible pang&#x2014;of guilt, of panic&#x2014;that can burble into the back of your mind, or the pit of your stomach, when you think about the future of life on Earth. But, Polar Bears International was arguing, it could also be a mascot&#x2014;a rallying point. By now, bears are all but guaranteed to disappear from a lot of their range. But the science suggests that there&#x2019;s still time to slow climate change down and, in the long term, keep the species&#x2014;and many others along with it&#x2014;from vanishing entirely.<br><br>Practically speaking, this leaves conservationists like Polar Bears International in a unique and sometimes disorienting position. Unlike with other species, the central threat to polar bears isn&#x2019;t something that can be tackled or solved on the ground, out in the immediate ecosystem. The only meaningful way to save the polar bear now is to influence the energy policies and behavior of people who live thousands of miles away&#x2014;which means, in part, influencing influential media personalities like Martha Stewart. At some point, polar bear conservation stopped being solely the work of scientists and became the work of lawyers, lobbyists, and celebrities as well. The bear is dependent on the stories we tell about it.<br><br>After spending the fall in Churchill, Polar Bears International&#x2019;s president, Robert Buchanan, would head back home to the United States and start traveling from city to city, hosting talks by scientists and zookeepers, trying to use the appeal of this one charismatic animal to inspire people to reduce their own carbon footprints, however slightly&#x2014;to drive less, to buy recycled goods. In Kansas City, PBI had partnered with the hardware chain Lowe&#x2019;s to get inner-city kids to weatherize their neighbors&#x2019; homes, saving energy for heating and cooling. In suburban Connecticut, they&#x2019;d cosponsored &#x201c;Polar Bear Empathy Day,&#x201d; at which members of the local Polar Bear Club, in a reversal of their traditional cold-water swims, put on heavy parkas and stood on a scorching beach in July to show solidarity with the bears in an overheating Arctic. All together, Robert regarded these strategies and stunts as a kind of psychological guerrilla warfare. &#x201c;Polar bears are in serious friggin&#x2019; trouble,&#x201d; he told me that morning on Buggy One. &#x201c;But until you change the consumer&#x2019;s attitude, you&#x2019;re not going to change the policy or the political will.&#x201d; By &#x201c;consumer,&#x201d; he presumably meant &#x201c;citizen.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a marketing gambit, after all. And Robert, a big man who talks in a languorous growl, felt very comfortable relating to it in those terms. This was his retirement. In his thirty-five-year career, he&#x2019;d risen to marketing director at Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, overseeing beverage and alcohol brands during the heyday of the corporation, when it owned Universal Studios and a large share of the music industry and was producing flashy wine-cooler commercials starring a young Bruce Willis. Robert handled cognacs and whiskey and Tropicana orange juice. &#x201c;I take products to market,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a marketer.&#x201d; Now he&#x2019;d put himself on the polar bear account.<br><br>Robert was literally trying to control the image of the polar bear in Churchill before that image was broadcast around the world. Churchill turns out to be the best, most convenient place in the world to see or film polar bears in the wild. (When you see a wild polar bear on TV or the Internet, the chances are good that you&#x2019;re looking at a Churchill bear.) Because Polar Bears International operates in close partnership with a tour company in Churchill that owns the majority of the permits and vehicles needed to access the animals on the tundra, the group has been able to intercept most of the major media that come through town. They install biologists and climatologists on the reporters&#x2019; buggies like scientific press agents, trying to make sure an accurate narrative comes across, and they provide B-roll footage of bears plunging into melting slush to help newscasters illustrate the problem. In past years, though, PBI had gone out of its way to help television crews only to feel betrayed by the finished product: the reporters ignore climate change altogether, or regurgitate the junk theories of climate change deniers. Most television crews are now asked to sign memorandums of understanding, outlining certain guidelines, before working with PBI. (As a rule, one PBI staffer told me, Robert regards all journalists as &#x201c;pirates and thieves.&#x201d;) But that fall, Martha Stewart hadn&#x2019;t signed one. And in the days before her arrival, her producers had become a little incommunicative about their plans. We&#x2019;d all headed out on Buggy One that morning because PBI had hoped to tour the tundra alongside Martha and her crew, docking back-to-back with Martha&#x2019;s buggy to pass people back and forth periodically for interviews. But that was starting to feel unlikely now. Though no one was quite saying it, there seemed to be concern that Martha Stewart was going rogue.<br><br>Everyone on Buggy One sat around for quite a while, not speaking much, while the cameraman stayed locked optimistically on the bear lumped in the mud outside, trying to gather whatever stock footage he could. Eventually, the polar bear got up and walked away. The cameraman shrugged.<br><br>We drove on. We looked for more bears. People noodled on their laptops and iPads. It felt aimless. Then, sometime after lunch, a voice crackled over the radio. It sounded like we would finally rendezvous with the Martha Stewart people and do a little filming on Buggy One. A PBI employee started wiping down the vehicle&#x2019;s counters with wet wipes. She hung everyone&#x2019;s parkas on coat hooks in the back. But when we got closer, we saw Martha&#x2019;s buggy receding in our windshield, fairly rapidly. &#x201c;Oh, they&#x2019;re moving now,&#x201d; our driver groaned.<br><br>All day, a strange paparazzi-like triangle had been materializing: Martha wanted good access to polar bears, and PBI wanted good access to Martha. I wanted to watch the whole process of brokering access, since I was quickly understanding that the media relations dimension of polar bear conservation was a critical part&#x2014;maybe the most critical part&#x2014;of the preservation of this five-million-year-old species.<br><br>Our driver pushed Buggy One as fast as it would go, which wasn&#x2019;t very fast, trying to gain ground.

Author <b>Timothy Samara</b> has added more than 50 new diagrams and more than 100 new images of real-world projects with an increased emphasis on web and environmental design projects. The "20 Rules for Good Design" has been revisited and expanded to 25 Rules. The book covers all the design fundamentals from working with grids, color application, typography, imagery to finally how to put it all together. Expansion and new material includes:</p><p>-Composition/layout, visual hierarchy -Form and composition in relation to concepts and meaning</p><p>-Color psychology and narrative-Color coding-Reference palettes for time periods, cultures, and businesses</p><p>-Special color and printing techniques -Combining type styles, editorial text setting issues, plus-Web-related type style and hierarchy issues</p><p>-Strategies for using photography; design drawing; medium and meaning; pictorial and non-pictorial -image-making options; semiotics, symbolic and metaphorical image use; type as image-Making type and imagery work better together</p><p>-Finding flexibility in design systems -The design process, from creative concept development and practical work-flow standpoints...</p><p>-Plus a complete project case study with major decision-moments keyed to respective sections!</p><p>Being a creative designer is often about coming up with unique design solutions. Unfortunately, when the basic rules of design are ignored in an effort to be distinctive, design becomes useless. In language, a departure from the rules is only appreciated as great literature if recognition of the rules underlies the text. Graphic design is a "visual language," and brilliance is recognized in designers whose work seems to break all the rules, yet communicates its messages clearly.This book is a fun and accessible handbook that presents the fundamentals of design in lists, tips, brief text, and examples. Chapters include Graphic Design: What It Is; What Are They and What Do They Do?; 25 Basic Rules of Good Design; Form and Space-The Basics; Color Fundamentals; Choosing and Using Type; The World of Imagery; Putting it All Together? Essential Layout Concepts; The Right Design Choices: 20 Reminders for Working Designers; and Breaking the Rules: When and Why to Challenge all the Rules of this Book.</p></p><p>Color Systems <p><b></b></p> <b>Limited Palettes in Photographic Images</b> <p></p> <p>Photographic images or illustrations with varied tonality are excellent material with which to explore ink coloration: An image might be printed in one, two, three, or more spot colors, with different portions of the image&#x2019;s tonal range acted upon by the inks at different levels. Such options give the designer an opportunity to customize images for a client, enrich the dialogue of color among images, type, and other graphic elements, and to bring images into closer visual alignment with brand-related color messages. Even when full-color photography is not only available as an option, but desirable, limiting the palette within the imagery will help it integrate with the palette applied to nonphotographic forms and typography&#x2014; such limitation can help focus attention on the most important components of the image&#x2019;s subject or emphasize important details. If the designer is lucky enough to have a budget that allows for commissioning original photography, he or she may art direct the photographer&#x2019;s use of lighting, props, backgrounds, and isolation of content in the frame to control the image&#x2019;s palette. A second option is to manipulate a photograph&#x2019;s native color using software to accomplish the same goal&#x2014;for example, saturating the yellow components of an important subject in the foreground and, subsequently, adjusting the color balance in surrounding areas to become cooler, even more violet, overall (skewing the tonality toward the yellow subject&#x2019;s complement, perhaps); the designer might further desaturate some features, or diminish their value contrast, to further emphasize the subject focus. That said, a designer may opt to completely change the color balance within a photograph for conceptual or formal effect: Who is to say that a photographic image must present the empirical (naturalistic) color as it appeared in nature? If the information the viewer needs from the subject doesn&#x2019;t depend on naturalistic color, radically altering the color of photographic images can accomplish a great deal.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <p></p><p><b>Timothy Samara</b> is a graphic designer based in New York City, where he divides his time between teaching, writing, lecturing, and consulting through STIM Visual Communication.

In this volume, Barron sets forth a thoroughgoing vision for an evangelical catholic theology that is steeped in the tradition and engaged with the contemporary world. Striking a balance between academic rigor and accessibility, the book covers issues of perennial interest in the twenty-first-century church: who God is, how to rightly worship him, and how his followers engage contemporary culture. Topics include the doctrine of God, Catholic theology, philosophy, liturgy, and evangelizing the culture. This work will be of special interest to readers concerned about the so-called "new atheism."</p><p>"Father Barron's bracing, stimulating essays remind us that the 'Church in permanent mission' to which Pope Francis has called Catholics must be thoughtful as well as merciful, culture-challenging as well as culture-forming, intellectually sharp as well as pastorally sensitive."<br>--<b>George Weigel</b>, author of <i>Evangelical Catholicism: Deep Reform in the 21st-Century Church</i><br><br>"These essays remind us how indispensable Fr. Barron is as a spokesman for the integrity and beauty of the Christian faith. He combines theological learning and depth with a remarkable gift for knowing what needs to be said--and how to say it."<br>--<b>R. R. Reno</b>, editor, <i>First Things</i><br><br>"Father Barron is a man of&nbsp;faith whose thirst for&nbsp;God has engendered an authentic intellectual quest.&nbsp;This book is the rarest of achievements, namely a demonstration in one short volume of how&nbsp;the doctrine of God,&nbsp;Christology, the Church, ethics, liturgy, and history go together in lived experience."<br>--<b>Matthew Levering</b>, Mundelein Seminary<br><br>"Today the Western Church has to proclaim the gospel in a culture that says it has outgrown religion, Christianity in particular.&nbsp;In this new and perilous situation, we have no more honest and reliable guide than Fr. Barron.&nbsp;He shows us how to remember and teach the truths about God and ourselves that our culture once knew but is now trying to forget--and trying to tempt the Church also to forget."<br>--<b>Bruce D. Marshall</b>, Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University<br><br>"An exceptionally readable introduction to modern theology. <i>Exploring Catholic Theology </i>could be read for pleasure and for profit by undergraduate students, professors, pastors, and lay parish leaders. Barron is recreating apologetics at a more imaginative and challenging level. Everyone who meditates on this book will discover something new about how to witness to the truth of Christianity in a postmodern culture."<br>--<b>Francesca Murphy</b>, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"In this book, Fr. Barron models the kind of pastoral theology and <i>ressourcement</i> envisioned by Vatican II. His is a theology founded on Scripture, tradition, and liturgy--but with windows open onto the world, engaging pop culture and high culture, politics and poetics, evangelicals and postmoderns, the new atheism and the old.

Hands-on project instructions will have you exploring what you've learned right away.<br><br>If you have been looking to add some shimmer to your weaving, this is the only book you will ever need!</p><p>Bobbie Irwin has been studying and teaching how to weave iridescence for more than 10 years, and it has become her most popular workshop. She has written many articles for Handwoven magazine and is the author of three books: Twist and Twine, The Spinner&#39;s Companion, and Twined Rag Rugs. She resides in Montrose, Colorado.Now thanks to Bobbie Irwin, I can create my own iridescent fabric with her book Weaving Iridescence: Colorplay for the Handweaver.<br>The book starts off with explaining iridescence, optics of light and color. The photographs help to interpret the results as well as give inspiration to your fiber choice, thread size and weave structure. Blue boxes highlight the information of the chapters. <br>Bobbie touches on getting the most out of iridescence with sewing garments, spinning, dyeing and knitting. Then, she shows you how to achieve this technique using a loom that requires from 4 to 8 shafts. The projects include color gamp napkins, a double weave scarf in a 4 and 6 shaft version, 4 shaft scarves using 3 and 4 color effects, clasping, vest fabric in double-weave and lightweight huck yardage.<br>She closes with a note on photography and the ins and outs of getting a good photograph of iridescent fabric. The photographs are well done and as I said before, lends them to motivate your creativeness. This is a one of a kind book to take your weaving and color appreciation to the next level. (Paula Moliver)<br><br>Twice in my weaving career, I've accidentally woven iridescent cloth. Both times, I chose a weft color based on a whim and ended up with magical, shimmering cloth. Bobbie Irwin, weaver and author of the aptly titled Weaving Iridescence, stumbled upon iridescence in a similar way. Her journey began, as great weaving discoveries often do, while sampling on the loom. Irwin decided to combine magenta with chartreuse, two colors she used frequently in her weaving with other colors but never together. The result was iridescent cloth and a desire to study this phenomenon, which is ultimately how this wonderful book came to be.<br><br>Although Irwin is a master of all things iridescent, even those beyond cloth, she makes few assumptions about the knowledge of the reader. The earliest chapters in her book are all about education. She explains what iridescence is and how it relates to other "-escence" words such as opalescence and luminescence. The book also explores the nature of light and color, giving the reader a good foundation of knowledge on which to stand before getting to the meat of the subject at hand.<br><br>The rest of the book is devoted to the subject of iridescence and how it works in weaving. Irwin teaches her readers the "rules" of iridescence (and how most of them can be broken) and how to choose colors, yarns, and weave structures to get this effect. She also, very interestingly, explains what iridescence isn't, giving examples of fabrics that are lustrous and often beautiful but not truly iridescent. The book ends with five projects designed to help the reader learn more about the nature of iridescence on the loom.<br><br>Such a book cannot truly be successful without good photography--and lots of it. As beautiful as iridescence is, it's also notoriously difficult to capture on film, but photographer Reed Irwin did this spectacularly. The book is full of gorgeous fabrics that seem to shimmer even on the printed page. As Irwin mentions in her "Note on Photography" at the end of the book, this is no accident--she actually delayed writing the book until photo technology was developed that could adequately capture this phenomenon. She also gives plenty of tips and tricks for any amateur iridescence photographers out there.<br><br>This book is a stunning work on a subject that has intrigued and delighted many a weaver throughout history. It is a must-have for any weaver who wants to harness the magic of iridescence.

Pantilat, a renowned international expert in palliative care demystifies the medical system for patients and their families. He makes sense of what doctors say, what they actually mean, and how to get the best information to help make the best medical decisions. Dr. Pantilat covers everything from the first steps after the diagnosis and finding the right caregiving and support, to planning your future so your loved ones don't have to. He offers advice on how to tackle the most difficult treatment decisions and discussions and shows readers how to choose treatments that help more than they hurt, stay consistent with their values and personal goals, and live as well as possible for as long as possible. <br></p><p>As a palliative care physician I often get calls and emails from friends, family and colleagues who are facing serious illness or who have a loved one with serious illness. They have questions about what the doctor means or how to decide about treatments. Serious illness can be confusing and frightening and you can&#39;t just google your way through. I share with them advice based on my 27 years of experience caring for thousands of seriously ill people. Every person asks if there&#39;s a book they can read to provide the same kind of guidance and I had to say &#34;no.&#34; Until now. That&#39;s why I wrote my book. I realized that there&#39;s a great need for a book to guide people with serious illness and their loved ones. A book that offers clear, concise, caring and compassionate information about the experience of serious illness and how to get the best care from the medical system. A book that focuses on the whole person, explains what doctors mean, provides the truth behind the myths about serious illness, and offers practical recommendations on what to do and when. I can&#39;t be with every person going through serious illness, so I wrote a book to serve as that personal guide.Steven Z.

Shoenberg, a former advertising executive, is the author or two other books, including <em>Geneen,</em> a much-praised biography of ITT founder Harold Green.Scholarly yet lively account of the legendary Prohibition- era gangster. Schoenberg (Geneen, 1984) chronicles Alphonsus Capone's Brooklyn origins; provides a microscopically detailed record of the gangsters, turf, and politicians of the decade of Capone's ascendancy in Chicago; and describes Capone's post-penitentiary retirement to Florida, where the dreaded gangster--infected with tertiary syphilis--spent his last years playing cards and fishing in the enforced calm thought necessary for syphilis victims. Schoenberg's closely focused annals provide an interesting view of the lesser-known young Capone, born in 1899 to an immigrant family. As a teenager, he was a member of the infamous Five Points gang and, by age 16, was working for Brooklyn boss Frankie Yale, serving an apprenticeship in extortion along the banks of the Gowanus Canal. Fleeing to Chicago after nearly beating to death an Irish member of the rival White Hand gang, the 21-year old Capone signed on with business-minded bootlegger and pimp John Torrio, who, besides dividing the Chicago turf with other mobsters such as the flower-loving Deany O'Banion, was expanding his operation into the middle-class suburbs. Capone mastered his volcanic temper, and, under the tutelage of the bland and friendly Torrio--whose signature remark was, ``We don't want any trouble''--took elocution lessons and became perhaps the first gangster to manipulate public relations, cooperating fully with photographers and making himself always available to reporters. At age 26, Capone bought the entire business from Torrio, who decided to return to Italy after being shot in the war that erupted after O'Banion's murder. Avoids the mythologizing of much Capone material, and likely to endure as a standard reference. (Eight pages of b&amp;w photographs, maps--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The media and advocacy groups shine a spotlight on some crimes and ignore others. Street crime is highlighted as putting everyone at risk of victimization, while the greater social harms from corporate malfeasance receive far less attention.<p> Social arrangements dictate what is defined as crime and the punishments for those who engage in the proscribed behavior. Interest groups promote their agendas by appealing to public fears. Justifications often have no basis in fact, but the public accepts the exaggerations and blames the targeted offenders. The net-widening effect of more laws and more punishment catches those least able to defend themselves.</p><p> This innovative alternative to traditional textbooks provides insightful observations of myths and trends in criminal justice. Fourteen chapters challenge misconceptions about specific crimes or aspects of the criminal justice system. Kappeler and Potter dissect popular images of crimes and criminals in a cogent, compelling, and engaging manner. They trace the social construction of each issue and identify the misleading statistics and fears that form the basis of myths and the collateral damage of basing policies on mythical beliefs. The authors encourage skepticism about commonly accepted beliefs, offer readers a fresh perspective, and urge them to analyze important issues from novel vantage points.</p><p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Potter-Kappeler, <i>Constructing Crime: Perspectives on Making News and Social Problems,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577664468) and Shelden et al., <i>Crime and Criminal Justice in American Society,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781478607656).</p></p><p>"I used this book several times in my classes and found it compelling to students.

Translated and edited under the auspices of The Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, DC, <i>The Brill Dictionary of Ancient Greek</i> is based on the completely revised 3rd Italian edition published in 2013 by Loescher Editore, Torino. Features The principal parts of some 15,000 verbs are listed directly following the entry and its etymology. For each of these forms, the occurrence in the ancient texts has been certified. When found only once, the location is cited. Nearly all entries include citations from the texts with careful mention of the source. The dictionary is especially rich in personal names re-checked against the sources for the 3rd Italian edition, and in scientific terms, which have been categorized according to discipline. Each entry has a clear structure and typography making it easy to navigate. "For a number of years now, scholars at ease in Italian have benefitted enormously from the riches, layout, concision, and accuracy of Professor Montanari's <i>Vocabolario della Lingua Greca</i>, with its added advantage of the inclusion of names.

More than half of police departments have no formal training whatsoever for newly appointed investigators. Most texts in police science either completely omit the issue of effective interviewing techniques or provide only superficial coverage. This manual provides guiding principles to effective interviewing, with specific techniques to be used and others to be avoided. There are principles of memory retrieval so that the reader will understand why to employ specific techniques -- for example, when to use open-ended versus direct short-answer questions, effective use of pauses, asking follow-up questions, cues to name and number recall, etc. There is the strategy of interview sequential structure -- that is, what to probe for at the beginning, middle, and end of the interview. Also included are practical exercises and real-world experiences. The book will also be helpful for attorneys in conducting investigative interviews.</p><p></p><h2>Young Mathematicians at Work: Constructing Multiplication and Division</h2><p>In our efforts to reform mathematics education, we've learned a tremendous amount about young students' strategies and the ways they construct knowledge, without fully understanding how to support such development over time.

The rationing of food, clothing, and other substances played a big part in making sure that everyone had a fair share of whatever was available. In this fascinating book, Katherine Knight looks at how experiences of rationing varied between rich and poor, town and country, and how ingenuous cooks often made a meal from poor ingredients. Charting the development of the rationing program throughout the war and afterwards, <i>Spuds, Spam and Eating for Victory</i> documents the use of substitutions for luxury ingredients not available, resulting in delicacies such as carrot jam and oatmeal sausages. The introduction of Spam from America in the forties led to this canned spiced pork and ham becoming an iconic symbol of the worst period of shortage in the twentieth century. Seventy years after the outbreak of the Second World War, this book listens to some of the people who were young during the conflict share their memories, both sad and funny, of what it was like to eat for Victory.</p><p><strong>Katherine Knight&nbsp;trained as a teacher of home economics before marrying and bringing up her four children.

At the age of seventy-nine, Nariman Vakeel, already suffering from Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, breaks an ankle and finds himself wholly dependent on his family. His step-children, Coomy and Jal, have a spacious apartment (in the inaptly named Chateau Felicity), but are too squeamish and resentful to tend to his physical needs. <br><br>Nariman must now turn to his younger daughter, Roxana, her husband, Yezad, and their two sons, who share a small, crowded home. Their decision will test not only their material resources but, in surprising ways, all their tolerance, compassion, integrity, and faith. Sweeping and intimate, tragic and mirthful, <b>Family Matters</b> is a work of enormous emotional power.</p><p>Set during the 1990s in an overcrowded and politically corrupt Bombay, Rohinton Mistry's <i>Family Matters</i> depicts a family being torn apart by lies, love, and its unresolved demons of the past. Nariman Vakeel is an aging patriarch whose advancing Parkinson's disease and its related complications threaten to destroy his large Parsi family. When Nariman breaks his ankle and becomes bedridden, his two stepchildren turn his care over to their half-sister, Roxanne, who lives in a two-room flat with her husband and two sons. What follows is each character's reaction to this situation, from Roxanne's husband's struggle to provide for his family without neglecting his conscience to their sons' coming of age in an era of uncertainty. Expertly interspersed between these dilemmas are Nariman's tortured remembrances of a forbidden love and its inescapable consequences ("no matter where you go in the world, there is only one story: of youth, and loss, and yearning for redemption. So we tell the same story, over and over. Just the details are different").<p> <i>Family Matters</i> is a compelling, emotional, and persuasive testimony to the importance of memories in every family's history. In a poetic style rich with detail, Mistry creates a world where fate dances with free will, and the results are often more familiar than anyone would ever care to admit. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>&#x201c;Mistry harks back to the 19th-century novelists. . . .

At a time when people expect the world to come to an end because of global warming or nuclear nightmares, at the hand of wrathful deities or the prediction of ancient calendars, Meade offers surprising tales of renewal as well as an in-depth treatise on the psychology and mythology of the end of an era. In place of simple apocalyptic scenarios, the author follows a knowing thread back to ancient notions of apocalypsis as a liminal period marking the passage between one era and the next. Apocalypsis involves eruptions in nature and disruptions of culture, but also makes possible revelations of a unifying principle and guiding force in each life. Apocalypsis uncovers the hidden unity that connects all of life; but only after the surface of life cracks and the expected patterns fail. He describes a time of indeterminate length when people face the choice of assisting with the renewal of the world or falling under the spell of collective anxieties and doomsday predictions.</p><p>Michael Meade, born and raised in New York City, is a renowned storyteller, author, and scholar of mythology, anthropology, and psychology.

Historians have agreed, and Taft is usually portrayed, when written about at all, as nothing more than a failed chief executive. In this provocative new study, the first treatment of the Taft presidency in four decades, Lewis L. Gould presents a compelling assessment of Taft's accomplishments and setbacks in office. Rich in human interest and fresh analysis of the events of Taft's four years in Washington, Gould's book shows why Taft's presidency is very much worth remembering on its own terms. <br><br>Gould argues that Taft wanted to be president and had an ambitious agenda when he took power in March 1909. Approaching his duties more as a judge than as a charismatic executive in the mold of Theodore Roosevelt, Taft soon found himself out of step with public opinion. Gould shows how the Payne-Aldrich Tariff and the Ballinger-Pinchot controversy squandered Taft's political capital and prepared the ground for Democratic victories in the elections of 1910 and 1912. His seamless narrative provides innovative treatments of these crucial episodes to make Taft's presidency more understandable than in any previous account. On Canadian Reciprocity, Dollar Diplomacy, and international arbitration, Gould's well-researched work goes beyond earlier stale clichs about Taft's administration to link his tenure to the evolution of the modern presidency. Taft emerges as a hard-working but flawed executive who lacked the excitement of Theodore Roosevelt or the inspiration of Woodrow Wilson. <br><br>The break with Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 doomed the Taft presidency, and Gould supplies an evenhanded analysis of the erosion of their once warm friendship. At bottom, the two men clashed about the nature of presidential power, and Gould traces with insight how this personal and ideological rupture influenced the future of the Republican party and the course of American politics. In Gould's skilled hands, this neglected presidency again comes alive. Leaving the White House in 1913, Taft wrote that "the people of the United States did not owe me another election." What his presidency deserved is the lively and wise appraisal of his record in office contained in this superb book.</p><p>"This is the best informed and most judicious study yet published about the Taft presidency. Gould has poured into this short book the product of his impressive research and extensive reflection about the politics of the progressive period, Taft's uncomfortable role therein, and not the least Taft's controversial relationship with Theodore Roosevelt."--John Morton Blum, author of <i>The Republican Roosevelt</i> and <i>The Progressive Presidents</i> <p>"Gould effectively and evenhandedly examines the sweet as well as the sour of this presidency, balancing Taft's intelligence, integrity, and efficiency on one side with a surprising impulsiveness and lack of intimate, reliable political advice on the other."--John Milton Cooper, author of <i>Pivotal Decades: The United States 1900-1920</i></p>Lewis L. Gould's many books include <i>The Modern American Presidency, The Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, The Presidency of William McKinley,</i> and most recently <i>Four Hats in the Ring: The 1912 Election and the Birth of Modern American Politics</i>.

Renouard is old enough to remember life before the Internet but young enough to have fully accommodated his life to the Internet and the gadgets that support it. Here this young philosopher, novelist, and translator tests a series of conjectures on how human experience, especially the sense of self, is being changed by our continual engagement with a memory that is impersonal and effectively boundless. Renouard has written a book that is rigorously impressionistic, deeply informed historically and culturally, but also playful, ironic, personal, and formally adventurous, a book that stands with comparison with the best of Roland Barthes and Jean Baudrillard.</p><p><b>Ma�l Renouard</b> is a French writer and translator. He was born in Paris and attended the �cole Normale Sup�rieure, where he would later teach philosophy. He served as the technical adviser for speeches in the cabinet of Fran�ois Fillon from 2009 to 2012. Renouard has translated works by Nietzsche, Joseph Conrad, and Arthur Schnitzler, among others, and between 2004 and 2010 was a regular contributor to the magazine <i>Trafic</i>.

Yet no president has stirred so much controversy, dominating media coverage and conversation both pro and con.<br> &nbsp;<br> Months after Trump took office, consumer confidence hit a seventeen-year high, unemployment plummeted to the lowest level in seventeen years, and the stock market zoomed to repeated record highs.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the same time, ISIS was nearly defeated, Arab countries banded together to stop financing terrorists and promoting radical Islamic ideology, and Trump&#x2019;s decision to send missiles into Syria because of its use of chemical weapons and his strident warnings to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made it clear to adversaries that they take on the United States at their peril. <br> &nbsp;<br> Yet for all the media coverage, Trump remains a cipher.

The book includes an exclusive interview with Trump, the only interview he says he has given or will give for a book as president.

When she joined the Trump Organization in 1981, he had only seven other employees. During her career with him, Foerderer oversaw almost every aspect of the mogul&#x2019;s business, including public relations, hiring and firing, and negotiating book deals and contracts. No one knew so well both the personal and business side of Donald Trump.<br><br>In the only in-�depth interview she ever gave, Foerderer, who has since died, told me there are two Donald Trumps: one is the Trump that appears to the public, making often outrageous comments on television to get attention; the other is the real Trump only insiders know.<br><br>&#x201c;I mean Donald can be totally outrageous, but outrageous in a wonderful way that gets him coverage,&#x201d; Foerderer told me. &#x201c;That persona sells his licensed products and his condominiums. You know Donald&#x2019;s never been shy, and justifiably so, in talking about how wonderful his buildings or his golf clubs are.&#x201d;<br><br>The private Trump, on the other hand, is &#x201c;the dearest, most thoughtful, most loyal, most caring man,&#x201d; Foerderer said. That caring side inspires loyalty and is one of the secrets to his success.<br><br>Confirming Foerderer&#x2019;s point, Trump wrote in The Art of the Deal that &#x201c;if you are a little different or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you.&#x201d; Trump followed his own advice in spades.<br><br>Illustrating the difference between the public and private Trump, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which represents 3.2 million business owners, announced during the campaign that its members would be boycotting all Trump&#x2019;s properties following his statements on illegal immigrants and his vow to build a wall across the entire Mexican border. But Trump subsequently met privately with Javier Palomarez, the chamber&#x2019;s CEO.<br><br>&#x201c;There were no bombastic statements of any sorts,&#x201d; Palomarez said admiringly on CNN as he left the meeting. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s kind of interesting, the dichotomy between the private Donald Trump and the public Donald Trump. He listened a lot more than he spoke.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet even back when he was running his business, Trump played employees off against each other and could erupt in unmitigated anger at them. For nearly three decades, Anthony P. &#x201c;Tony&#x201d; Senecal was Trump&#x2019;s personal butler at Mar-�a-�Lago, Trump&#x2019;s home and club in Palm Beach, Florida. When Trump hired Bernd Lembcke to be the managing director of his newly opened club, he introduced Senecal to him.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s mine,&#x201d; Trump told Lembcke. &#x201c;Nobody touches him but me.&#x201d;<br><br>From that day on, Trump would give Senecal instructions that Lembcke, given his job title, should have been carrying out, including plans for renovation and suggestions on employees who should be fired. According to Senecal, Lembcke steadfastly ignored him, never carrying on a conversation with him. &#x201c;It was like he would see me, and he would see the wall,&#x201d; Senecal says.<br><br>As with everything else in his empire, Trump exaggerated Senecal&#x2019;s importance. Senecal is a former mayor of Martinsburg, West Virginia. He came to national attention when the Washington Post accompanied a front-�page feature story about changes in West Virginia with a photo of Senecal sitting with his cat Morris on the shoeshine stand of his tobacco shop.<br><br>&#x201c;When I first started, I wasn&#x2019;t the servant type,&#x201d; Senecal told me. &#x201c;It was touch-�and-�go, until Mr. Trump found out I was a former mayor. That made me a cut above. Then,&#x201d; Tony said wryly, &#x201c;I became the mayor of the wealthiest and largest town in West Virginia.&#x201d; In fact, Martinsburg is neither.<br><br>One Saturday, alerted that there was a visitor, Senecal opened the door at the main entrance to Mar-�a-�Lago to find Martha Stewart standing there. She had bicycled over to the club, and she asked if she could take a tour. Happy to oblige, Senecal asked her to return the next day at three p.m. when it would be convenient for Senecal, whom Trump eventually named the Mar-�a-�Lago historian.<br><br>When Trump came by later that day, Senecal told him about Martha Stewart and the tour he had set up for Sunday.<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, just treat her right,&#x201d; Trump said.<br><br>But hours later, Senecal went to see if Trump needed anything. He encountered his boss outside the master bedroom in what is known as the Pine Hall, a glittering antechamber with a crystal chandelier and murals that had once graced the walls of homes in France.<br><br>Without warning, Trump lit into the butler, screaming at him and calling him a &#x201c;dumb ass&#x201d; for scheduling the tour at three p.m. when workers would be shifting furniture around. Trump yelled that Senecal instead should have scheduled the tour for lunchtime, when well-�heeled club members would be on hand to impress and be impressed by Martha Stewart. A perfectionist, Trump could not stand it when things were not done his way.<br><br>As her husband was tearing into Senecal, Melania entered the Pine Hall.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you should talk to Tony in that tone,&#x201d; Melania said to Trump in her usual soft voice.<br><br>Stewart had not left a phone number nor said where she was staying. But Senecal used what he calls the &#x201c;Palm Beach butler network&#x201d; to find her and reschedule the tour for around noon the next day.<br><br>Trump never said another word about it. But the next morning when he and Senecal were in the mansion&#x2019;s living room, Trump, without explanation, handed him two thousand dollars in twenties.<br><br>&#x201c;It was his way of apologizing,&#x201d; Senecal says.<br><br>Despite the occasional blistering tirades, Senecal says he loved working for Trump, who would act as if nothing had happened after delivering an attack. To be sure, giving his butler cash in twenties was strange, but, &#x201c;Everything about Mr. Trump is strange,&#x201d; Senecal says.<br><br>Trump was often generous with praise for employees at all levels when they were doing a good job. He would make it a point to compliment them in front of their bosses.<br><br>&#x201c;He keeps a wad of hundred-�dollar bills in his pants pocket and will distribute them widely to groundskeepers, plumbers, or other low-�level employees when he likes the job they are doing,&#x201d; Senecal says.<br><br>There are three things none of Trump&#x2019;s employees should do, Senecal says: &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t steal from him, you don&#x2019;t lie to him, and you don&#x2019;t embarrass him.&#x201d;<br><br>Senecal says Melania&#x2019;s quiet comment and her husband&#x2019;s later remorse is typical of her influence. Almost always, Melania delivers her advice in private, but occasionally, Senecal would pick up on their exchanges.<br><br>&#x201c;Melania rules the roost,&#x201d; Senecal says.<br><br>Some years ago, when Senecal&#x2019;s home air-�conditioning system gave out, Trump had it replaced. When Senecal paid his own way to attend Trump&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s funeral in New York in June 1999, Trump was so touched he ordered his pilot to fly the butler back to Palm Beach, a passenger of one. The cost for jet fuel and maintenance for the flight to Florida and the return was forty thousand dollars.<br><br>When Senecal needed surgery to implant a stent, Trump called him and asked, &#x201c;So when do you go under the knife?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tomorrow,&#x201d; said Senecal.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if you don&#x2019;t make it, don&#x2019;t worry about it. You&#x2019;ve had a good life,&#x201d; Trump said. And then he said, &#x201c;Listen, I don&#x2019;t want you going back to your place. You come and recuperate at Mar-�a-�Lago.&#x201d;<br><br>Trump will hand out hundred-�dollar bills to janitors or McDonald&#x2019;s cashiers and write checks for tens of thousands of dollars to people he has learned are in distress. But one of the White House media staff&#x2019;s frustrations was that Trump did not want the public to see this side of him and know what he is like behind the scenes, Spicer says.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll walk into a room with a bunch of workers, and gather them up and hand them out each a hundred-�dollar bill,&#x201d; an aide says. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no camera there. Those are the moments people just don&#x2019;t see, like when he&#x2019;s telling us about how an emotional event has impacted him, and he doesn&#x2019;t want anyone to see it. He likes to display the tough, rough exterior.&#x201d;<br><br>In the same way, Ronald Reagan quietly wrote personal checks to people who had written him with hard-�luck stories.<br><br>&#x201c;Reagan was famous for firing up Air Force jets on behalf of children who needed transport for kidney operations,&#x201d; says Frank J. Kelly, who drafted Reagan&#x2019;s presidential messages. &#x201c;These are things you never knew about. He never bragged about it. I hand-�carried checks for four thousand or five thousand dollars to people who had written him. He would say, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t tell people. I was poor myself.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Like Reagan, Trump never forgot what it is like to be down and out. That was in the 1990s when his companies were $3.4 billion in the hole, and he was personally liable for $830 million of that debt, giving him a negative net worth.<br><br>One day, Trump was walking along Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower with his then-�wife Marla Maples.<br><br>&#x201c;I pointed across the street to a man holding a cup and with a seeing eye dog,&#x201d; Trump wrote in The Art of the Comeback.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know who that is?&#x201d; Trump asked Marla.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Donald. He&#x2019;s a beggar. Isn&#x2019;t it too bad? He looks so sad!&#x201d; she replied.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. He&#x2019;s a beggar, but he&#x2019;s worth about $900 million more than me,&#x201d; Trump said to her.<br><br>When Trump came up with the idea of branding his condos and office buildings back in the 1980s, everyone in the real estate business thought he was nuts: traditionally, obscure companies that no one had ever heard of sold and leased real estate.<br><br>But the Trump brand came to stand for quality, prestige, and success. In the same way, Trump brands his presidency, marketing himself by making provocative comments to get attention. That brand consists of the tough-�guy image Trump wants to project, never admitting a mistake or showing his softer side, keeping his emotions in check, always counterpunching when he is attacked.<br><br>Whether in real estate or politics, Trump sees himself as the Lone Ranger, always fighting for what he believes in against the establishment. To Trump, admitting mistakes or showing an emotional side is a sign of weakness. As president, Trump wanted staff photographer Shealah Craighead to photograph him mainly at official functions and from a distance, gazing out a window, never betraying emotion. His typical facial expression is to set his mouth in a moue, somewhere between a pucker and a pout. It says, I&#x2019;m a handsome guy; I&#x2019;m going to WIN.<br><br>Trump&#x2019;s tough guy image goes back to his childhood growing up in Queens, New York, where he could erupt in anger, pummeling another boy or smashing a baseball bat when he struck out. In school, he misbehaved so often that the initials DT became his friends&#x2019; shorthand for detention.<br><br>Trump has said that his primary focus in elementary school was &#x201c;creating mischief, because for some reason, I liked to stir things up, and I liked to test people&#x201d;&#x2014;�not out of maliciousness but rather aggressiveness.<br><br>&#x201c;Who could forget him?&#x201d; said Ann Trees, who taught at Kew-�Forest School, where Trump was a student through seventh grade. &#x201c;He was headstrong and determined. He would sit with his arms folded with this look on his face&#x2014;�I use the word surly&#x2014;�almost daring you to say one thing or another that wouldn&#x2019;t settle with him,&#x201d; according to the Washington Post book Trump Revealed by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher.<br><br>His older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, described Trump as extremely rebellious.<br><br>&#x201c;He tested the rules and the teachers to their limits,&#x201d; said Barry, now a senior circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. A camp counselor said Trump had an &#x201c;ornery&#x201d; disposition. He said he would &#x201c;fight back all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He had a reputation for saying anything that came into his head,&#x201d; said Donald Kass, who was a schoolmate. When Trump misidentified Rocca, the pro wrestler, Kass recalled, &#x201c;We would laugh at him and tell him he was wrong, and he&#x2019;d say he was right. The next time, he would make the same mistake, and it would be the same thing all over again.&#x201d;<br><br>Trump wanted to be first at everything and wanted everyone to know he was first. His highly competitive nature came out in his love of baseball.<br><br>&#x201c;I like to hear the crowd give cheers, so loud and noisy to my ears,&#x201d; Donald wrote as a poem in his yearbook. &#x201c;When the score is five to five, I feel like I could cry. And when they get another run, I feel like I could die&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br><br>To teach him discipline, Trump&#x2019;s father sent him to military school when he was in the eighth grade. Like Trump, Fred Trump, a builder and developer, was a perfectionist. He wore a jacket and tie even at home. While his father could be sharply critical if tasks were not performed perfectly, Trump respected him and has described him as his hero. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, was charming, vivacious, and shrewd. Like her son, she enjoyed socializing and being the center of attention.<br><br>Trump&#x2019;s self-�destructive moves&#x2014;�from the firing of FBI director James Comey that led to the appointment of a special counsel, to failing to emphasize his condemnation of white nationalists and domestic Nazis in Charlottesville&#x2014;�go back to an instinctive, defensive need to hit back at critics, no matter the consequences. For all his wealth and all his power, he seems to feel cornered, much like the instincts that led him to be a bad boy as a kid.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gotten a sense he always feels under attack,&#x201d; Spicer says. &#x201c;That people are saying that he didn&#x2019;t earn this, that he&#x2019;s not this, he didn&#x2019;t win this, he can&#x2019;t do X. He&#x2019;s not smart enough. He didn&#x2019;t do whatever it is. I think that he constantly feels under attack, and he feels the need to justify his position, either on an issue or position or how he came to achieve something. He has built up a DNA of defensiveness.&#x201d;<br><br>Now that bad boy had become president.</p><h2>Inner Speed Secrets: Mental Strategies to Maximize Your Racing Performance</h2><p>Maximize your driving ability with tips from the experts!

Isolating his star cast in the wilds of West Texas, director George Stevens brought together a volatile mix of egos, insecurities, sexual proclivities, and talent. Stevens knew he was overwhelmed with Hudson&#x2019;s promiscuity, Taylor&#x2019;s high diva-dom, and Dean&#x2019;s egotistical eccentricity. Yet he coaxed performances out of them that made cinematic history, winning Stevens the Academy Award for Best Director and garnering nine other nominations, including a nomination for Best Actor for James Dean, who died before the film was finished.</p><p> In this compelling and impeccably researched narrative history of the making of the film, Don Graham chronicles the stories of Stevens, whose trauma in World War II intensified his ambition to make films that would tell the story of America; Edna Ferber, a considerable literary celebrity, who meets her match in the imposing Robert Kleberg, proprietor of the vast King Ranch; and Glenn McCarthy, an American oil tycoon; and Errol Flynn lookalike with a taste for Hollywood.

Beloved by millions, her books have been translated into 28 languages.Susan lives in Washington with her husband, two cats, and a small poodle with delusions of grandeur. Visit her at SusanMallery.com.Maya Farlow told herself there was a perfectly good explanation for the mayor of Fool's Gold to have a picture of a man's naked butt on her computer screen. At least she really hoped there was. She'd always liked Mayor Marsha and didn't want to find out something more than a little icky about the woman who was now her boss.<br><br>Mayor Marsha sighed heavily and pointed to the screen. "You're not going to believe this," she said, and tapped a key. The picture moved as the video played and the audio started up.<br><br>"The contest closes on Friday at noon. Text your guess to this number."<br><br>Maya stared at the computer. When the picture stopped again, she studied the phone number onscreen, the seventy-something female host frozen midgesture and the picture of the naked butt behind her. The naked, <em>male</em> butt, Maya corrected mentally, not sure the gender mattered as much as the nakedness.<br><br>"Okay," Maya said slowly, knowing that she would be expected to say something else. Possibly something, you know, intelligent. But honestly, she couldn't think of what that could be. How on earth was she supposed to make an old lady in a tracksuit talking about a naked butt contest make sense? Of course, that was a much happier concern than finding out Mayor Marsha watched porn.<br><br>Mayor Marsha pushed a couple of buttons on her computer and the image disappeared. "You can see the problem we're having with Eddie and Gladys's cable access show."<br><br>"Too many naked butts?" Maya asked before she could help herself. Stating the obvious was never helpful, but what on earth else was there to say?<br><br>Mayor Marsha Tilson was California's longest serving mayor. She looked exactly as she had twelve years ago when Maya had been a nervous sixteen-year-old, moving to a strange little town and hoping to fit in. The mayor still wore classically tailored suits and elegant pearls. Her white hair had been swept up in a tidy chignon. As a teenager, Maya hadn't known what to make of the mayor. Today, she thought the other woman was someone to be admired. Mayor Marsha ran her town with a firm but fair hand. Even more important to Maya, the mayor had offered her a job right when Maya had known she had to make a change in her life.<br><br>So here she was, the shiny new communications director for Fool's Gold, California. And the old lady with the naked butt contest was apparently now her problem.<br><br>"Eddie and Gladys have always been colorful," Mayor Marsha said with a sigh. "I admire their zest for life."<br><br>"And interest in younger men," Maya murmured.<br><br>"You have no idea. Their cable access show is extremely popular with locals and tourists alike, but we've been getting some emails and phone calls about some of the content."<br><br>"You need me to rein them in."<br><br>"I'm not sure if that's possible, but yes. We don't want to have to deal with the FCC. I know two of the commissioners and I don't want to be fielding calls from friends in high places, so to speak." The older woman shuddered. "Or explain what on earth is going on in this town."<br><br>After seeing a clip of the show, Maya would have guessed there was nothing anyone could say for the rest of the day that would surprise her more than a woman pushing eighty showing a naked butt on television and inviting viewers to text in their guess on which famous local celebrity it might be. Maya would have been wrong. Mayor Marsha personally knowing an FCC commissioner or two beat naked butts hands down.<br><br>So to speak.<br><br>She made a few more notes on her tablet. "Okay. I'll talk to Eddie and Gladys and explain about the indecency restrictions for broadcast shows."<br><br>She had a good idea what the requirements were but would have to look up the specifics. She had a feeling the TV duo were not the types to be intimidated by vague rumblings of FCC rules. She would have to go into the discussion armed.<br><br>"You are getting thrown in the deep end, aren't you?" Mayor Marsha smiled at her. "This is only your second day. I hope you're not regretting your decision to take the job."<br><br>"I'm not," Maya assured her. "I love a good challenge."<br><br>"Then consider yourself blessed." The mayor glanced at her notepad. "Next up we need to discuss our new video campaign. The city council wants a two-pronged approach. The first set of videos will be about our town slogan. Fool's Gold: A destination for romance. The second set will be in support of general tourism."<br><br>They'd discussed the new campaign at Maya's interview. "I have a lot of ideas for both," she said eagerly.<br><br>"Good. We're still coming up with more ways to use the videos. They'll be put on the town's website, of course. But we'll also want them to be used for commercials. Both on the internet and television."<br><br>Maya nodded as she typed on her tablet. "So thirty-second spots for sure, with additional cuts of the material in one- and two-minute lengths? The message varying, depending on the target audience?"<br><br>"I'll leave the technical aspects of it to you, Maya. Also, any ideas you have for increasing viewership of the videos would be appreciated. The city council is a dynamic group, but we're not tech savvy. You're going to have to lead the way on that."<br><br>"Happy to."<br><br>She had some contacts, she thought. Not anyone at the FCC, but friends in advertising who would be happy to brainstorm ideas. It would be easy to edit material so that it appealed to different interests. Focus on the outdoor activities the town had to offer on ESPN and sports websites. Show family-friendly things to do on cable channels more traditionally watched by women, with links on websites that appealed to women with children.<br><br>While this kind of work was different from what she was used to, she was excited by the possibilities. Her previous job, at a local TV station in Los Angeles, had become too comfortable. And her attempts to get hired by the network had failed, leaving her at loose ends. The job offer in Fool's Gold had come along at exactly the right time.<br><br>"You're going to need some help," Mayor Marsha told her. "There's simply too much work for one person. Especially if we want the videos done by the end of summer."<br><br>Maya nodded in agreement. "I'd prefer to do the editing myself. There's an art to it." And trusting someone else with her content would be difficult. "But I could use someone to help preproduction and during the shoots."<br><br>"Yes. Plus an on-air talent person. Is that what it's called? Or is <em>host</em> a better word?"<br><br>Maya felt a minor twinge. After all, in a perfect world, she would be hosting the videos. But the truth was, the camera didn't love her. It liked her well enough, but not so much with the love. And in the business that was any kind of recorded media, passion was required. Which meant they needed someone who dazzled on-screen.<br><br>"Someone local?" she asked, thinking of all the sports celebrities in the area. Plus, she knew that action movie superstar Jonny Blaze had just bought a ranch outside of town. If she could get him, that would be a coup.<br><br>"I had someone else in mind," Mayor Marsha said.<br><br>As if on cue, the mayor's assistant knocked on the door and then stepped into the room. "He's here. Should I send him in?"<br><br>"Please do, Bailey," Mayor Marsha told her.<br><br>Maya glanced up, curious as to whom the mayor would consider for such an important job. There was a lot on the line for the town and Mayor Marsha always put Fool's Gold first. If he&#x2014;<br><br>Maybe it was a trick of the light, Maya thought frantically as her eyes focused. Or a mistake. Because the tall, broad-shouldered, slightly scruffy guy walking toward them looked alarmingly familiar.<br><br>She took in the too-long curly hair, the three-day beard and the oversize, well-worn backpack slung over one shoulder. As if he'd just stepped off a pontoon plane direct from the Amazon forest. Or out of one of her dreams.<br><br>Delany Mitchell. Del.<br><br>The same Del who had stolen her virginity and her eighteen-year-old heart and had promised to love her forever. The Del who had wanted to marry her.<br><br>The Del she'd walked out on because she'd been too young and too scared to take a chance on believing that she was the least bit lovable.<br><br>His jeans were so worn they looked as soft as a baby's blanket. His white shirt hung loose, the long sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He was that irresistible combination of disheveled and confident. The ultimate in sex appeal.<br><br>How could he be back in town? Why hadn't she known? And was it too late to bolt from the room?<br><br>Mayor Marsha smiled with pleasure, then rose. She crossed to the man and held out her arms. Del stepped into her embrace, hugged her, then kissed her cheek.<br><br>"You haven't changed at all," he said by way of greeting.<br><br>"And you've changed quite a bit. You're successful and famous now, Delany. It's good to have you back."<br><br>Maya stood, not sure what she was supposed to do or say. Back as in <em>back?</em> No way, no how. She would have heard. Elaine would have warned her. <em>All living, breathing, handsome proof to the contrary,</em> she thought.<br><br>Ten years later, Del still looked good. Better than good.<br><br>She found herself fighting old feelings&#x2014;both emotional and physical. She felt breathless and foolish and was grateful neither of them was looking at her. She had a second to get herself under control.<br><br>She'd been so young back then, she thought wistfully. So in love and so afraid. Sadly, fear had won out and she'd ended things with Del in a horrible way. Maybe now she would finally get the chance to explain and apologize. Assuming he was interested in either.<br><br>The mayor stepped back and motioned to her. "I think you remember Maya Farlow. Didn't the two of you used to see each other?"<br><br>Del turned to glance at her. His expression was an ode to mild curiosity and nothing else. "We dated," he said, dismissing their intense, passionate relationship with casual disregard. "Hello, Maya. It's been a long time."<br><br>"Del. Nice to see you."<br><br>The words sounded normal enough, she told herself. He wouldn't guess that her heart was pounding and her stomach had flopped over so many times she feared it would never be right again.<br><br>Was it that he didn't remember the past, or had he truly put it all behind him? Was she just an old girlfriend he barely recalled? She would have thought that was impossible, and she would have been wrong.<br><br>He looked good, she thought, taking in what was new and what was exactly as it had been. His features were sharper, more honed. His body bigger. He'd filled out. Grown up. There was a confidence to his gaze. She'd fallen in love with a twenty-year-old, but before her was the adult male version.<br><br>The puzzle pieces fell into place. Her meeting and discussion with the mayor. What was expected of her as far as promoting the town. The need for a well-known person to host the videos.<br><br>Her lips formed the word <em>No</em> even as her brain held in the sound. She turned to Mayor Marsha.<br><br>"You want us to work together?"<br><br>The older woman smiled and took her seat at the conference table, then motioned for Del to sit, as well.<br><br>"Yes. Del's back in town for a couple of months."<br><br>"Just for the rest of the summer." He settled in a chair that seemed too small for him. His grin was as easy as his posture. "You guilted me into helping."<br><br>Mayor Marsha's blue eyes twinkled with amusement. "I might have done what needed doing to get you to agree," she admitted. She turned to Maya. "Del has experience with filming. He's made some videos himself."<br><br>He shrugged. "Nothing that special, but I do know my way around a camera."<br><br>"As does Maya. I would like the two of you to collaborate on the project."<br><br>Maya told herself to keep breathing. That later, when she was alone, she would scream or keen or throw something. Right now, she had to remain calm and act like a professional. She had a brand-new job she very much wanted to keep. She loved Fool's Gold, and since moving back to town, she'd felt more content than she could remember ever feeling before. She didn't want that to change.<br><br>She could handle Del being back. Obviously he was 100 percent over her. Which was a good thing. She was over him, too. Way over. So over as to almost not remembering him. Del who?<br><br>"Sounds like fun," she said with a smile. "Let's set up a meeting to brainstorm what has to be done."<br><br>She was smooth, Del thought, watching Maya from across the small conference table. Professional. She'd stayed friends with his mother, so he heard about her every now and then. How she'd been promoted to senior producer at the local news station in Los Angeles, and how she wanted to get to a network position. Showing up in Fool's Gold was an unexpected left turn in her career path.<br><br>Just as unanticipated had been the call from Mayor Marsha, inviting him to be a part of the town's new publicity project. She'd phoned about fifteen minutes after he'd already decided he was coming home for the summer. The woman had mad skills.<br><br>"How about tomorrow?" Maya asked. "Why don't you call me in the morning and we'll set up a day and time?"<br><br>"Works for me."<br><br>She gave him her cell number.<br><br>Mayor Marsha's desk phone beeped.<br><br>"Excuse me," the mayor said. "I need to take this call. I'll leave you two to work out the details."<br><br>They all rose. Del and Maya walked into the hallway. Once there, he half expected her to bolt, but she surprised him by pausing.<br><br>"When was the last time you were back?" she asked.<br><br>"It's been a couple of years. You?"<br><br>"I came home to visit Zane and Chase a couple of months ago and never left."<br><br><em>Her brothers,</em> he thought. Technically her stepbrothers, but he knew they were the only family she had. While he'd grown up in a loud, close-knit, crazy family, Maya hadn't had anyone but an indifferent mother. She'd made her own way in the world. Something he'd respected about her, until that trait had turned around and bit him on the ass.<br><br>"You're a long way from Hollywood," he said.<br><br>"You're a long way from the Himalayas."<br><br>"So neither of us belongs here."<br><br>"Yet here we are." She smiled. "It's good to see you, Del."<br><br><em>You, too.</em><br><br>He thought the words, but didn't say them. Because it was good, damn her. And he didn't want it to be. Maya was born trouble. At least she had been for him. Not that he would make that mistake again. He'd trusted her with everything he had and she'd thrown it back in his face. Lesson learned.<br><br>He nodded at her, then swung his backpack over his shoulder. "I'll talk to you tomorrow."<br><br>Her smile faltered for a second before returning. "Yes, you will."<br><br>He watched her go. When she was out of sight, he thought about going after her. Not that there was anything to say. Their last conversation, a decade ago, had made everything clear.<br><br>He told himself the past was the past. That he'd moved on and was long over her. He'd gone his way and she'd gone hers. Everything had worked out for the best.<br><br>He walked out of City Hall and toward the lakefront. There was a continuity to the town, he thought as he looked around and saw tourists and residents coexisting. City workers were changing the banners, taking down those celebrating the Dog Days of Summer Festival and hanging the ones proclaiming the Maa-zib Festival. This time last year, they'd been doing the same thing. And the year before and a year from now. While there were a handful of recent businesses opening, truth was the heart of the town never changed.<br><br>Brew-haha might be a new place to get coffee, but he knew that when he walked inside he would...</p><h2>Navajo Code Talkers</h2><p><p><b><i>Navajo Code Talkers</i> tells the story of this special group, who proved themselves to be among the bravest, most valuable, and most loyal of American soldiers during World War II. </b></p><p>On the Pacific front during World War II, strange messages were picked up by American and Japanese forces on land and at sea. The messages were totally unintelligible to everyone except a small select group within the Marine Corps: the Navajo code talkers-a group of Navajos communicating in a code based on the Navajo language. This code, the first unbreakable one in U.S. history, was a key reason that the Allies were able to win in the Pacific.</p></p><p><p><b>Nathan Aaseng</b> grew up in Minnesota and worked as a microbiologist for four years before becoming a writer. He has written over ninety books for young readers. He lives in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, with his wife, Linda, and their four children.</p>Grade 5-9-- A fascinating account that sheds light on a little-known contribution of the Navajos during World War II. A civil engineer who spent his childhood among them suggested that their language be used as a perfect unbreakable code. The result was one of the most secret and important aspects of U. S. intelligence work against the Japanese--Navajo code talking. Aaseng details the process by which native-speaking volunteers developed, learned, and used the complicated coding process to send and receive vital information even when the Japanese were intercepting the messages. He gives many examples of the dangers and prejudice the Native Americans faced in the armed services, as well as the special hardships they endured because of their cultural differences. The short, readable chapters are illustrated with photographs from the National Archives and the Library of Congress. This is a book that will appeal to a wide range of students--those interested in army intelligence and cryptography, and in World War II or Native American history. It should prove helpful for reports, but is interesting enough to recommend for recreational reading. --Yvonne A.

Set in the near future in the fishing village of Kuinak, Alaska, a remnant outpost of the American frontier not yet completely overcome by environmental havoc and mad-dog development, <b>Sailor Song</b> is a wild, rollicking novel, a dark and cosmic romp. The town and its denizens&#x2014;colorful refugees from the Lower Forty-Eight and DEAPs (Descendants of Early Aboriginal Peoples)&#x2014;are seduced and besieged by a Hollywood crew, come to film the classic children's book The Sea Lion. The ensuing turf war escalates into a struggle for the soul of the town as the novel spins and swirls toward a harrowing climax. Writing with a spectacular range of language and style, Kesey has given us a unique and powerful novel about America.</p><p><b>Ken Kesey</b> was born in 1935 and grew up in Oregon. He graduated from the University of Oregon and later studied at Stanford with Wallace Stegner, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Scowcroft, and Frank O' Connor. <b>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</b>, his first novel, was published in 1962. His second novel, <b>Sometimes a Great Notion</b>, followed in 1964. His other books include <b>Kesey's Garage Sale</b>, <b>Demon Box</b>, <b>Caverns</b> (with O. U. Levon), <b>The Further Inquiry</b>, <b>Sailor Song</b>, and <b>Last Go Round</b> (with Ken Babbs). His two children's books are <b>Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear</b> and <b>The Sea Lion</b>. Ken Kesey died on November 10, 2001.After 25 years, a new novel from Kesey--a brilliant, funny, heartening tale of the power of love to stomp out evil in the last decent town on earth--proves that the heroic old Trickster can still pitch a fastball. Just after the turn of the millennium, Isaak Sallas, a.k.a ``the Bakatcha Bandit,'' a legendary environmental warrior from the ``Nasty Nineties,'' wakes up in his antique trailer to confront a couple of unwelcome omens from the end of the world. The most deadly sign is the silvery albino Nick Levertov, the bad-seed son of Alice (``the Angry Aleut''), battering the hell out of blowzy Louise Loop. The next day, watching a huge silver movie-company yacht sail into the harbor with Levertov aboard, Sallas realizes that Levertov has come back to Kuinak, Alaska, to settle a score of grievances. A couple of decades before, Sallas, once a CIA flier who won the Navy Cross, had to bear the death of his baby daughter- -a death caused by his own exposure to pesticides. The tragedy transformed him absolutely. The next day, he used his pesticide plane to drop a fragrant load on an upper-middle-class crowd at a California county fair: right ``Bakatcha.'' His fire had burned out long since, he now thinks. He'd hoped to live in peaceful obscurity in this last unpolluted backwater, fishing with the jolly Brit skipper Carmody and his Rasta sidekick Greer. Now, however, with Levertov buying up and corrupting the town with wads of movie money and piles of a designer drug called ``Scoot,'' Sallas discovers that he has the stuff--the love and faith--to drive evil out of town: ``Dolls were being set up, and being knocked down. The situation was in progress, and in dedicated lock; it couldn't be blinked and it couldn't be ducked.'' A wonderful tale for the times, proving Kesey is ``Bakacha'' after all these years. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Think <i>Zen</i> and the <i>Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, complete with stock cars, sexy vegetables, and a laugh track. </p> <p> "All I wanted to do was fix my old pickup truck," says Michael Perry. "That, and plant my garden. Then I met this woman. . . ." <i>Truck: A Love Story</i> recounts a year in which Perry struggles to grow his own food ("Seed catalogs are responsible for more unfulfilled fantasies than Enron and Penthouse combined"), live peaceably with his neighbors (one test-fires his black powder rifle in the alley; another's best Sunday shirt reads 100 PERCENT WHUP-ASS), and sort out his love life. But along the way, he sets his hair on fire, is attacked by wild turkeys, takes a date to the fire department chicken dinner, and proposes marriage to a woman in New Orleans. As with <i>Population: 485</i>, much of the spirit of <i>Truck: A Love Story</i> may be found in the characters Perry meets: a one-eyed land surveyor, a paraplegic biker who rigs a sidecar so that his quadriplegic pal can ride along, a bartender who refuses to sell light beer, an enchanting woman who never existed, and half the staff of National Public Radio. </p> <p> By turns hilarious and heartfelt, a tale that begins on a pile of sheep manure, detours to the Whitney Museum of American Art, and returns to the deer-hunting swamps of northern Wisconsin, <i>Truck: A Love Story</i> becomes a testament to the surprising and unintended consequences of love. 1006 </p></p><p><p>Michael Perry is a humorist, radio host, songwriter, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of several nonfiction books, including <em>Visiting Tom</em> and <em>Population: 485</em>, as well as a novel, <em>The Jesus Cow</em>.

And yet, for Perry, it was all that and more: an epic adventure that encompassed love, diplomacy, a little hydroponics, and even some danger (like setting yourself on fire). Perry, who is also the author of -<i>Population: 485</i> (2002), propels the story forward as if he were writing a novel, helped by a cast of characters who range from the lightly offbeat to the totally bizarre. The prose is straightforward, almost deadpan, but behind the words, the reader feels a heightened sense of irony, as though Perry knows how weird it all is but figures, what the heck, it's true so why not just go with it. The heart of the book tells dual love stories--man and truck; man and woman--that are, in their own ways, equally passionate. Perry writes about fixing his truck as if he was resurrecting it, but in fact, he may more accurately be said to have been resurrecting himself. The truck is transformed, certainly, but the multiplicity of changes that Perry goes through run deeper and likely will last longer. Recommend this one enthusiastically to fans of self--exploration books and truck-repair manuals--and all readers in between.

Part of the icon&#39;s symbolism is transmitted in the techniques used to create it and this is explored throughout, with in depth information, step-by-step demonstrations, invaluable advice and many superb examples of finished icon painting.</p><p>Gilles Weissmann studied at the Beaux-Arts in Paris, exploring Egyptian painting, sculpture, Chinese Buddhist art, Mesopotamian art, and Roman art. He owns a studio and school of iconography in Paris, where he teaches and paints.Nov 12 This book differs from all the other art books I have reviewed in two respects. Firstly, this is not secular but sacred art and secondly, the materials are in the main totally different. Forget your oils or watercolors, these are real art materials that have been used for this type of work for centuries. This is not a book for the total beginning painter either, as some artistic talent and knowledge is taken as given. Working through the steps it is not too hard to produce something that looks like the finished image. Maybe I would also add a third difference, that this is not art as free expression of the painter&#39;s own personality but the depiction of Christian imagery. The book opens with some icons from the classic era and the story of how they came to be. This includes a brief summary of the symbolism of icons, and then it is on to the practical part of the book. Learn how to make the actual wood and fabric base for the painting (see, I told you this was a different sort of art book) and what you need to obtain for the whole process. Be warned that some of the items are highly toxic, and much care is needed in using them. Find out what part an egg plays in drawing with a paintbrush, and work through a good example of an icon--gilding and all--in usual Search Press style through staged photographs. There are other icons to paint too, with a simplified system of how they are painted in stages that reminded me of the How To Draw series, and finally a gallery of work to admire and be inspired by. This is a truly unique and lovely book that ought to result in a flowering of many icons. * Myshelf.com * Aug 12 Anyone who has been in an Eastern Orthodox church, or seen Byzantine icons in museums and art galleries cannot fail to be amazed by the sheer colour, exuberance and brilliance of the icons. It is a very traditional method of painting, hundreds of years old which is still in use today. But how do you achieve that glowing result? This book is the perfect answer. It explains the techniques used by icon artists and shows how to achieve good results. What is equally useful is the historical background that is provided, together with a study of the symbolism used in icons. There are some superb examples of finished icon paintings by modern artists making it a very inspirational book. Useful too are the inscriptions provided in several languages including Greek and Slavonic. The book demonstrates that icon painting remains a vibrant, living artistic style offering techniques which modern artists can usefully utilize. * Monstersandcritics.com *</p><h2>The Kybalion - Hermetic Philosophy - Revised and Updated Edition</h2><p>An occult classic Since its first publication in 1908, The Kybalion, Hermetic Philosophy by Three Initiates, has been in constant demand by students and investigators of the Secret Doctrines.

Right at that moment, he was also in the process of driving Dr. Charlotte &#x201c;Charlie&#x201d; Stone totally around the bend.<br><br>&#x201c;We could be on a beach right now,&#x201d; he groused, referring to the fact that she had elected to return to work rather than take the extended vacation that had been recommended after her most recent death-�defying experience. His tone was light. His eyes on her were dark and watchful. He was worried about her, she knew. To tell the truth, she was worried about herself. &#x201c;Sand. Sun. You in a bikini. Come on, Doc, confess: you&#x2019;ve got something against fun.&#x201d;<br><br>He only ever called her Doc anymore when he was seriously ticked off at her. Short version: he felt she needed to take some vacation time while she disagreed. At thirty-�two years old, Charlie had been in charge of herself since her early teens. She did not need a man&#x2014;�ghost, whatever&#x2014;�constantly second-�guessing her decisions.<br><br>Her brows snapped together.<br><br>&#x201c;Go away,&#x201d; she mouthed at him soundlessly, after a quick glance assured her that her living companion&#x2019;s attention was occupied elsewhere.<br><br>Michael snorted. &#x201c;Not in this life, buttercup.&#x201d; One corner of his mouth quirked up slightly. &#x201c;Or in this death, either.&#x201d;<br><br>Oh, ha, ha. But she didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;�couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;�say it aloud. If they&#x2019;d been alone, Charlie would have done more than shoot him an exasperated look. She would have told him to take his fun and stick it up a bodily orifice. Fun was not what life was all about. Life was serious. Purposeful. Sometimes painful. And&#x2014;�well, definitely not fun.<br><br>But they weren&#x2019;t alone. In fact, they were even less alone than he thought they were.<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t tell.&#x201d; The agonized whisper made Charlie&#x2019;s heart thump. Her fingers tightened around the pen she was holding. The (living) convicted serial killer chained to a seat on the other side of the poured concrete table from her never changed his expression. Neither did the dead convicted serial killer&#x2014;�that would be Michael, looking as alive as she did herself, in a snug white tee, faded jeans, and boots&#x2014;�who leaned broad shoulders against the beige-�painted cinder-�block wall to her left as he played self-�appointed spectral bodyguard. Which was a complete waste of time, as she had told him when he&#x2019;d insisted on following her into the interview room rather than waiting outside in the hall as she would have preferred so that she could concentrate fully on her research subject. Number one, there was no need: in this heavily guarded maximum security prison, of all places, she was perfectly safe. And number two, if something were to go wrong, if she were to find herself in danger, there was nothing he could do about it anyway. He was ectoplasm; ether; air. He couldn&#x2019;t so much as swat a fly, because in this earthly plane he no longer existed. In the past, he had occasionally managed to manifest physically for the briefest of moments, but because in typical-�for-�him aggressive fashion he had pushed the boundaries of that until he had gone a heavenly bridge too far, he had, apparently permanently, rendered himself as insubstantial as a breath. And even if he could once again manage to manifest physically, he still couldn&#x2019;t: he&#x2019;d been warned that if he did, if he once again took on a corporeal aspect, the bond holding him here might very well snap like a rubber band and he would be sucked up into Spookville, as he called the purple twilighty, monster-filled place that was his immediate afterlife destination, possibly never to return.<br><br>Therefore, as Charlie had pointed out to him earlier, as a bodyguard Michael was useless.<br><br>And even if he wasn&#x2019;t useless, even if he could manifest, there was still nothing he could do to protect her from what was currently disturbing her: the voices.<br><br>The voices were all in her head.<br><br>Sort of.<br><br>At least, she seemed to be the only one who could hear them. Her gift, or curse, depending on how you looked at it, was that she could see/hear/communicate with the spirits of the newly, violently dead (which was how she had found herself saddled with Michael, a former subject of her research who&#x2019;d been stabbed to death shortly after leaving this very room about six weeks back). But Charlie could only hear this woman. Whom she couldn&#x2019;t be completely sure was real. Or dead.<br><br>&#x201c;When&#x2019;s the last time you even took a vacation?&#x201d; Folding his arms over his chest, Michael narrowed sky blue eyes at her. At six-�foot-�three, with tawny blond hair that didn&#x2019;t quite reach his shoulders and a face and body that would make any female between the ages of twelve and ninety drool, he was one of the best-�looking men she had ever seen. Too bad he was a total pain in the ass. Not to mention dead. Among other problematic things. He continued, &#x201c;A real vacation, that didn&#x2019;t involve work, where you just went somewhere sunny and hung out in your bathing suit and relaxed. I&#x2019;m betting it&#x2019;s been years. Hell, I&#x2019;m betting you don&#x2019;t even own a bikini. Am I right?&#x201d;<br><br>She shot him a look that should have singed his eyeballs. And not just because the only swimsuit she possessed was a five-�year-�old black one piece.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m right,&#x201d; he concluded with grim satisfaction.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my candy?&#x201d; whined the live serial killer she could actually answer without seeming nuts. Her attention instantly redirected toward her job, Charlie pulled from the pocket of her white lab coat the Hershey bar that she had elected to use as a reward (bribe) for this particular subject for responding to her questions, one of which he had answered just before Michael had distracted her. Opening the wrapper, she broke off a section and slid it across the table, then watched her test subject scoop it up and eat it with a great deal of lip-�smacking satisfaction. The shackles joining his wrists clanked as he moved. He also had manacles around his ankles securing him to the floor, and a chain around his waist that was fastened to a sturdy metal ring in the wall behind him. It prevented him from rising, or getting close enough to actually put his hands on her.<br><br>She might be the goat to his deceptively harmless-�looking tiger, but in this controlled environment he was the tethered one.<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t give me chocolate,&#x201d; Michael objected. &#x201c;Hell, I didn&#x2019;t know chocolate was even an option.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie ignored that. She was administering a simplified version of the Myers-�Briggs personality test to the hulking, balding fifty-�two-�year-�old convict in front of her. They were alone except for Michael (since he was invisible to everyone except her, she wasn&#x2019;t sure he even counted) and the guard, Johnson, who periodically checked on them through the small glass window in the metal door. Outside the walls of Wallens Ridge State Prison, where they were currently seated in the tiny, windowless room next to her office, her test subject was known as the Snake River Killer. His given name was Walter Spivey, and he was a hairdresser by trade. He was also notorious as the murderer of fourteen young women whose flesh he had liked, post-�mortem, to gnaw from their bones, and he had been on various death rows for the past twelve years. Two months earlier, he had been moved to Wallens Ridge for the express purpose of participating in her government-�sponsored study. An apparent anomaly among serial killers, who tended to have higher than average IQs, Spivey was of special interest to her because his IQ of rec�ord was 82. Her meetings with him had convinced her that this was an error, or possibly an attempt by some psychiatrist in the pay of Spivey&#x2019;s defense lawyers to circumvent a death sentence, because in many jurisdictions a low IQ was considered a mitigating factor. Whatever, it had been satisfying for her to determine that a serial killer who had at first seemed like the exception to the rule probably was not, after all. He was crazy like a fox&#x2014;�in other words, cunning and manipulative.<br><br>A psychiatrist with her own dark personal history with serial killers, Charlie had thought she was immune to the bad vibes that the worst of them emanated.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been wrong. With his pale, sweaty skin and loose, damp mouth, Spivey creeped her out. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that she was a slender, pretty brunette like the majority of his victims, whose pictures she had seen in his file, but she didn&#x2019;t really think so. Before&#x2014;�meaning before nearly dying had totally messed her up&#x2014;�being shut up like this with him wouldn&#x2019;t have bothered her at all. She would have regarded Walter Spivey with the clinical detachment of a medical student toward a cadaver.<br><br>Now she found that being near him made her skin crawl. The only possible solution? Ignore it. Power through. And hope it went away.<br><br>&#x201c;Again, please just answer yes or no,&#x201d; she said to Spivey. From her calm voice, of which under the circumstances she was justly proud, to the up-�twist in which she wore her shoulder-�length chestnut hair, to her understated jewelry and the simple blue shirt and black pants beneath her lab coat, Charlie was to all outward appearances unflappably professional. If anxiety had caused her to chew her lipstick off when the voices had started up again just before she&#x2019;d sat down with Spivey, and if there were shadows resulting from a certain amount of sleeplessness beneath her blue eyes, well, hopefully nobody would notice. &#x201c;You usually place yourself nearer to the side than the center of a room.&#x201d;<br><br>Michael snorted. &#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s going to answer honestly? Take it from me, by the time you get to death row you&#x2019;ve pretty much figured out that I as in introvert is bad, E as in extrovert is good. So he&#x2019;s going to say no, because everyone knows that preferring the center makes him more of an extrovert, and thus closer to an E than an I. Nobody wants to fry, babe. Everybody you&#x2019;re talking to in here is working every angle they can to avoid it.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie didn&#x2019;t know why she was surprised to discover how much Michael knew about the MBTI personality test. He was highly intelligent. Manipulating the test was something that he was absolutely capable of doing. If he knew that introversion was a mild indicator of a sociopathic personality, then she was pretty confident that he also knew that INTJ&#x2014;Introversion, intuition, thinking, judgment&#x2014;�was the Myers-�Briggs personality type most common among serial killers. She spared a minute to try to remember what Michael&#x2019;s type was&#x2014;�she hadn&#x2019;t gotten around to testing him herself before he was killed, although she knew he&#x2019;d been tested before&#x2014;�and couldn&#x2019;t; when she got back to her office, she would pull his file and check.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Spivey responded with a sunny smile, and as Charlie recorded his answer, he looked pointedly at the Hershey bar. &#x201c;Can I have my candy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Told ya.&#x201d; Michael&#x2019;s tone was smug as Charlie broke off another section of candy bar and slid it over. The tips of Spivey&#x2019;s fingers just brushed hers. They felt soft and damp. The contact made her stomach tighten, and she quickly pulled her hand back. Michael continued, &#x201c;And just so you can quit racking your brain, I scored ESFP. And that was without being bribed by chocolate.&#x201d;<br><br>The curious thing was, ESFP&#x2014;�extraversion, sensing, feeling, perception&#x2014;�was the exact opposite of INTJ. Absolutely not the mark of a serial killer. As far from it as a subject could possibly get, in fact. Charlie&#x2019;s lips twisted. No way had that been an accident. Michael had, no doubt, manipulated the test. As she reached that conclusion, she shot him a condemning look. He grinned, a slow and devilishly charming grin that admitted everything.<br><br>And just as easy as that he had her going all marshmallowy inside.<br><br>Damn it. She refocused on her test subject with grim determination.<br><br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t do this to me.&#x201d; The disembodied whisper came out of nowhere, snapping her right back into the Amityville Horror that her life was devolving into like a quick plunge into ice water. The terror in the voice sent chills down Charlie&#x2019;s spine. Her instant, instinctive reaction was to glance at Michael, furtively searching his face to see if he&#x2019;d heard it, too. If the woman she was hearing was present in spirit, even if the timing and circumstances of her death put her beyond the parameters of Charlie&#x2019;s ability to see her, Michael should be able to see her, because as a spirit himself he could see other spirits in his vicinity, just like she was able to see any living, breathing human who might, for example, walk into the room.<br><br>But Michael clearly wasn&#x2019;t seeing whoever was connected to the voice. He wasn&#x2019;t hearing her, either.<br><br>Okay, deep breath. This was different. This was outside Charlie&#x2019;s experience. This was a whole new facet of the freak show that was her existence. It had been happening to her only since she had died and been brought back.</p><h2>Finding Your Child&#39;s Way on the Autism Spectrum: Discovering Unique Strengths, Mastering Behavior Challenges</h2><p>It seems that nearly everyone knows a family with an autism spectrum child.

That young man was international tennis star David Wheaton. A touching portrait emerges of an inseparable bond between a man and his dog. Their story, marked by devotion, humor, and unexpected turns, shares an uplifting message that the God of all grace offers strength and hope in our most trying times.</p><p>My conversion as a dog owner took place almost immediately after Ben came home. Here I thought I was getting a dog to find and flush pheasants during the fall hunting season in the Upper Midwest. Confirming that intention was the outdoor dog run that had been constructed in our yard in anticipation of his arrival. &#x201c;Dogs live outside,&#x201d; after all. At least that is where our family dogs had always lived, for as long as I could remember. Ben was different, much different. He would never spend a night in that pen. In fact, it was soon dismantled and removed, which provided the first clue that I had changed. Or rather, that I had been changed simply by the presence of a different kind of dog that didn't demand in-house residence but rather just seemed to belong there.It didn't take long for me to realize that I had received something far more than &#x201c;a dog.&#x201d; Rather, I had been blessed with a year-round, life-enriching relationship that would expand my boundaries of joy and sorrow and help me understand poignant lessons about life and faith.This is the story of my boy Ben. It's a story about love and loss. But mostly, it's a story about grace.My Boy, Ben is David Wheaton&#39;s second book. David also writes for the Minneapolis Star Tribune and hosts a nationally-syndicated radio program.

One of the most influential Roman perspectives on religion came from a nonreligious belief system that is finding new adherents even today: Stoicism. How did the Stoics think about religion? In <i>How to Think about God</i>, Philip Freeman presents vivid new translations of Cicero's <i>On the Nature of the Gods</i> and <i>The Dream of Scipio</i>. In these brief works, Cicero offers a Stoic view of belief, divinity, and human immortality, giving eloquent expression to the religious ideas of one of the most popular schools of Roman and Greek philosophy.</p><p><i>On the Nature of the Gods</i> and <i>The Dream of Scipio</i> are Cicero's best-known and most important writings on religion, and they have profoundly shaped Christian and non-Christian thought for more than two thousand years, influencing such luminaries as Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Dante, and Thomas Jefferson. These works reveal many of the religious aspects of Stoicism, including an understanding of the universe as a materialistic yet continuous and living whole in which both the gods and a supreme God are essential elements.</p><p>Featuring an introduction, suggestions for further reading, and the original Latin on facing pages, <i>How to Think about God</i> is a compelling guide to the Stoic view of the divine.</p></p><p><b>Philip Freeman</b> is the author of more than twenty books on the ancient world, including the Cicero translations <i>How to Be a Friend</i>, <i>How to Grow Old, </i>and <i>How to Run a Country</i> (all Princeton). He holds the Fletcher Jones Chair as a Professor of Humanities at Pepperdine University and lives in Malibu, California."From Stoic arguments for pantheism to the music of the heavenly spheres, this fine volume of the incomparable Cicero offers a fascinating exploration of ancient philosophical thinking about the divinity of the universe and the immortality of the soul."<b>&#x2015;John Sellars, author of <i>Hellenistic Philosophy</i></b><br><br><i>"How to Think about God</i> should be essential reading for anyone interested in ancient belief. Cicero's <i>On the Nature of the Gods</i> shows how the Stoics argued for the existence of a provident deity, laying the foundations for Christianity, while his <i>Dream of Scipio</i>, one of the most celebrated mystical passages in antiquity, offers perspective on earthly troubles through a profound, moving, and consoling vision of the place of human life in the cosmos. Freeman's translations allow modern readers to experience the grandeur of this vision, which still inspires awe."<b>&#x2015;Donald Robertson, author of <i>How to Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius</i></b></p><h2>Black Orchids/The Silent Speaker: Nero Wolfe Mysteries</h2><p><b>A NERO WOLFE SPECIAL EDITION&#x2014;TWO COMPLETE MYSTERIES IN ONE VOLUME </b><br><br>&#x201c;Nero Wolfe towers over his rivals...he is an exceptional character creation.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>New Yorker</i><b> </b>A grand master of the form, Rex Stout is one of America&#x2019;s greatest mystery writers, and his literary creation Nero Wolfe is one of fiction&#x2019;s greatest detectives. In this double helping of classic Nero Wolfe mysteries, Stout presents the arrogant, gourmandizing, sedentary sleuth and his trusty man-about-town, Archie Goodwin, with a pair of delectable murders that no connoisseur of the whodunit could possibly resist. <br><br><b>BLACK ORCHIDS </b><br>Not much can get Wolfe to leave his comfortable brownstone, but the showing of a rare black orchid lures him to a flower show. Unfortunately, the much-anticipated event is soon overshadowed by a murder as daring as it is sudden. It&#x2019;s a case of weeding out a cunning killer who can turn up anywhere&#x2014;and Wolfe must do it quickly. Because a second case awaits his urgent attention: a society widow on a mailing list of poison-pen letters leading to a plot as dark as any orchid Wolfe has ever encountered.<br><br><b>THE SILENT SPEAKER<br></b>When a government power broker scheduled to speak before an influential group of millionaires turns up dead, Nero Wolfe grudgingly takes the case&#x2014;even as his own financial affairs teeter toward ruin. Soon a second victim is discovered, a missing stenographer&#x2019;s tape causes a panic, and a dead man speaks, after a fashion. As the business world demands answers, the great detective baits a trap to net a killer worth his weight in gold.</p><p>Rex Stout (1886-1975) wrote hundreds of short stories, novelas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.<i>Chapter One<br>What Are the Odds in&nbsp;Times like These?<br><br>&nbsp;</i>The self-owned and -operated business is the freest life in&nbsp;the world.&#x2014;<i>Paul Hawken&nbsp;</i><br><br>When I answered the phone, I was startled to hear a man whispering,&nbsp;&#x201c;Hi, this is Scott. I&#x2019;m calling from work, but I had to talk&nbsp;to you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I want to be JJ,&#x201d; he whispered back.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Jay Jay?&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Jay Jay? Why&#x2019;s he telling me this?&#x201d;&nbsp;Before I could ask, he went on to explain that he loathed his&nbsp;job and longed to be &#x201c;joyfully jobless.&#x201d; We made an appointment&nbsp;for him to call back when he could talk out loud.&nbsp;<br><br>Scott&#x2019;s not the only one, of course. One memorable message arrived&nbsp;in my email box with the title &#x201c;Cowering in my cubicle.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Every day I hear from people who have come to the same conclusion.&nbsp;Some have no idea what they want to do instead of having a&nbsp;conventional job. Others have an idea but don&#x2019;t know how to get&nbsp;started. And recently, more people who find themselves without a&nbsp;job are looking at alternatives and options they may not have&nbsp;considered before.&nbsp;<br><br>My own journey began when I was in the midst of a second career&nbsp;and found myself as miserable as I had been in my first job.&nbsp;Ironically, I had landed a position as a job counselor, working for&nbsp;the Minnesota Department of Employment Services. Shortly after&nbsp;arriving there (and already realizing I was not cut out to be a bureaucrat),&nbsp;I discovered a gigantic book called <i>The Dictionary of&nbsp;Occupational Titles. </i>This book contains tens of thousands of job&nbsp;descriptions. &#x201c;Surely,&#x201d; I thought, &#x201c;if I read this book, I&#x2019;ll find my&nbsp;lost career.&#x201d; In any free moment, I&#x2019;d grab the dictionary and begin&nbsp;reading. The more I read, the more discouraged I became.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing here I want to do,&#x201d; I lamented. I feared I was&nbsp;doomed to a life of drudgery.&nbsp;<br><br>That&#x2019;s not how my story ends, of course. I discovered that I&nbsp;could create my own work, be my own boss, and eventually get&nbsp;paid generously to do the things I loved. Along the way, I made&nbsp;wonderful new friends and plenty of mistakes. There were moments&nbsp;when I thought I had taken leave of my senses&#x2014;and many&nbsp;more moments when I could hardly believe my good fortune.&nbsp;What I never imagined back at the beginning was that I&#x2019;d end up&nbsp;teaching thousands of people how to leave behind the nine-tofive&nbsp;world and start building something on their own.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, the people coming to my self- employment seminars&nbsp;and teleclasses bring plenty of questions with them, but the one I&nbsp;get asked the most seemingly has nothing to do with making a&nbsp;living without a job. The most frequently asked question I&#x2019;ve ever&nbsp;received came after I relocated three years ago. &#x201c;Why did you&nbsp;move to Las Vegas?&#x201d; is the one I hear over and over.&nbsp;<br><br>The runner-up is &#x201c;Do you actually think <i>anyone </i>can be selfemployed?&#x201d;&nbsp;Almost always, the person asking the question&nbsp;sounds shocked or at least skeptical. I have several answers to the&nbsp;first question, but my usual response to the second has been &#x201c;Yes,&nbsp;I think anyone <i>can </i>be self- employed, but not everyone <i>will </i>be.&#x201d;&nbsp;As of this writing, there seems to be another topic that&#x2019;s&nbsp;grabbed everyone&#x2019;s attention: the current and confusing economic&nbsp;recession. Everything, from news stories to personal decisions,&nbsp;seems to be filtered through this growing crisis. So, of&nbsp;course, the question I&#x2019;m hearing more often these days is &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t&nbsp;this a dangerous time to start a business?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>That&#x2019;s certainly a fair question, and I can answer it as only a Las&nbsp;Vegan might: &#x201c;Have you considered the odds?&#x201d; Unlike the rest of&nbsp;the world, here in Las Vegas our casinos boldly post the odds,&nbsp;warning that they&#x2019;re not in your favor if you&#x2019;re about to gamble.&nbsp;That doesn&#x2019;t deter folks who hope to beat those odds.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the common assumptions about self- employment is&nbsp;that it is intrinsically risky. I&#x2019;d like to suggest that you think about&nbsp;the odds of success if you are making a life change. How do you&nbsp;calculate odds? Not being a gambler myself, odds weren&#x2019;t something&nbsp;I gave much thought to until I was fretting about the possibility&nbsp;of a giant calamity, such as being devastated by an&nbsp;earthquake or some natural disaster. I mentioned my qualms to&nbsp;my sister Margaret, who calmly asked, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know the odds&nbsp;are always in your favor?&#x201d; I was startled by that answer and shook&nbsp;my head, so she explained further, &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you noticed that even&nbsp;in large catastrophes, more people survive than don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>That was a new insight to me, so I began looking for evidence.&nbsp;Sure enough, Margaret was absolutely right. No matter what crisis&nbsp;is going on, more people are unaffected than harmed. Knowing&nbsp;this has kept me calm in situations that previously would&nbsp;have scared the wits out of me.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x2019;ve also considered that if the odds are in my favor&#x2014;and&nbsp;yours&#x2014;in times of calamity, how much more must they be on our&nbsp;side when we&#x2019;re creating something about which we care deeply?&nbsp;Even though a topsy- turvy economy has an impact on everyone&nbsp;at some level, many will be far less affected than others. And&nbsp;some will come through it better than before it happened. Let&#x2019;s&nbsp;look at how the odds are shifting.&nbsp;<br><br>Most of us grew up in a Big Is Better culture. Our parents and&nbsp;older siblings seemed to draw their self- esteem from working for&nbsp;giant companies. It didn&#x2019;t matter that these companies did not&nbsp;possess a soul or that their workers were discouraged from thinking&nbsp;creatively. Spending their days in a cubicle became socially&nbsp;acceptable. The company was big and that was impressive.&nbsp;As we watch the collapse of gigantic institutions (the list gets&nbsp;longer every day), we can join the doom-and-gloom crowd and&nbsp;see this as the end of our world as we know it. Or we can see it as&nbsp;a groundswell of change that is bringing with it unimagined opportunities,&nbsp;opportunities that will be the basis of the Small Is&nbsp;Better culture that&#x2019;s been quietly emerging for several years.&nbsp;More than a decade ago, trendspotter Faith Popcorn pointed out&nbsp;that more and more of us would move out of corporate confines&nbsp;and into our own businesses. In her book <i>The Popcorn Report, </i>she<i>&nbsp;</i>says that satisfaction and having control over our own time are&nbsp;going to be top priorities. Popcorn writes, &#x201c;After a shocking period&nbsp;of corporate greed, after years of commuting, people are&nbsp;dreaming of renovating old houses, starting hands-on entrepreneurial&nbsp;businesses, or even doing what they&#x2019;ve built their careers&nbsp;doing&#x2014;but on their own time and terms. We are asking ourselves&nbsp;what is real, what is honest, what is quality, what is really important.&nbsp;. . . Nobody works harder, or happier, or more productively,&nbsp;than people working for themselves.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>So why haven&#x2019;t we all figured that out? Could it be that making&nbsp;a living without a job is almost never an option offered by guidance&nbsp;counselors? Why do colleges continue to turn out corporate&nbsp;workers when the trend is in a different direction? Have the&nbsp;myths about risk scared us away?&nbsp;<br><br>Despite living in the shadow of an old paradigm about work,&nbsp;every day more of us decide to inhabit this new creative minority.&nbsp;A few years ago, I became a Junior Achievement volunteer. For&nbsp;six weeks, I spent an hour every week with a group of lively&nbsp;fourth-graders. The first day I was there, I introduced myself to&nbsp;the class and told them about my business. Then I asked if anyone&nbsp;knew somebody who ran a small business from home. Nearly&nbsp;two-thirds of the kids raised their hands. That probably wouldn&#x2019;t&nbsp;have happened even a decade earlier.&nbsp;<br><br>Now hardly a day passes when I don&#x2019;t read about or meet&nbsp;someone who is happily working on their own. At the end of&nbsp;2003, a London newspaper headline proclaimed, &#x201c;Huge Rise in&nbsp;Workers Who Go It Alone.&#x201d; The article stated that an estimated&nbsp;300,000 people in the U.K. had decided to abandon their jobs to&nbsp;go out on their own just that year.&nbsp;<br><br>The U.S. Census Bureau, in a report from the late 1990s, shared&nbsp;this affirming information: &#x201c;In the past, a homebased business&nbsp;was viewed as a side business operated primarily as a hobby or as&nbsp;a source of secondary income. The data contained in this study&nbsp;show that assertion to be inaccurate. The researchers&#x2019; findings&nbsp;demonstrate how the home has become a hub of business activity,&nbsp;entrepreneurship, and business creation. Sole proprietorships,&nbsp;partnerships, and S corporations added <i>$2.9 trillion to the&nbsp;economy, with homebased firms contributing $314 billion, or 11 percent.</i>&#x201d; The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports that<i>&nbsp;</i>every year there are dramatic increases in the numbers of home&nbsp;business operations.&nbsp;<br><br>What does a tiny business offer that a big one doesn&#x2019;t? Why are&nbsp;the odds in favor of the small enterprise? To begin with, <i>small is&nbsp;flexible. </i>Times change, and smart small businesses change with&nbsp;them. No slow bureaucracy needs to be approached for permission&nbsp;before change can be implemented. The ability and willingness&nbsp;to change as necessary ups the odds that a company will&nbsp;weather tough times.&nbsp;<b><br><br>Small is accessible. </b>Your guidance counselor may have forgotten&nbsp;to tell you this, but the free enterprise system is wonderfully open&nbsp;to anyone who wishes to participate, providing their intentions&nbsp;are honorable. You don&#x2019;t have to look very far to see entrepreneurs&nbsp;who are young, old, educated, uneducated, immigrants, physically&nbsp;challenged, women, social activists, and introverts. That list&nbsp;doesn&#x2019;t even begin to describe the array of people who have&nbsp;found success working on their own.&nbsp;<b><br><br>Small is diversified. </b>Financial gurus have always advised investors&nbsp;to diversify their portfolios. That same advice can be applied&nbsp;to earning that money. In this book, you&#x2019;ll be introduced to&nbsp;the idea of creating Multiple Profit Centers. Once you understand&nbsp;the value of having several income sources, you&#x2019;ll be eager to start&nbsp;building your own portfolio of moneymakers. Not only will this&nbsp;affect your earnings, it will also eliminate the Eggs in One Basket&nbsp;syndrome (which is devastating if the one and only income&nbsp;source disappears).&nbsp;<b><br><br>Small can be frugal when necessary. </b>Anyone who has built a&nbsp;business on a shoestring knows how to be thrifty. In fact, some&nbsp;folks discover how creative they can be when they tap into their&nbsp;imagination to solve problems.&nbsp;<br><br>One of my favorite entrepreneurial role models was Anita Roddick,&nbsp;founder of The Body Shop. In her early days in business, she&nbsp;had no money to advertise, so she created attention- getting signs&nbsp;for her shop windows to draw customers in. Even after The Body&nbsp;Shop was an international chain, the company never spent a&nbsp;penny for advertising but found creative ways to let people know<i>&nbsp;</i>it was there.&nbsp;<br><br>Spendthrifts aren&#x2019;t nearly as good at improvising.

At nearly sunset on a Sunday, downtown was mostly quiet&#x2014;though she could see a few cars parked in the lot of the historic Episcopalian church that had been the first brick structure in town, back when Hope's Crossing was a hustling, bustling mining town with a dozen saloons. Probably a Sunday-evening prayer service, she guessed.<br><br>Farther away, she could see more cars and a bustle of activity near Miners' Park and she suddenly remembered a bluegrass band was performing on the outdoor stage there for the weekly concert-in-the-park series.<br><br>Maybe she should have opted for an evening of music in the park instead of heading up into the mountains. She always enjoyed the concerts on a lovely summer night and the fun of sitting with her neighbors and friends, sharing good music and maybe a glass of wine and a boxed dinner from the cafe.<br><br>No, this was the better choice. As much as she enjoyed outdoor concerts, after three days of dealing with customers nearly nonstop at the outdoor art fair she had just attended in Grand Junction, she had been desperate for a little quiet.<br><br>Next to her, Jacques, her blond Labradoodle, stretched out on the dirt trail with a bored sort of air, tormenting a deerfly with the effrontery to buzz around his head.<br><br>"You don't have any patience when I have to stop to catch my breath, do you?"<br><br>He finally took pity on the fly&#x2014;sort of&#x2014;and swallowed it, then grinned at her as if he had conquered some advanced Jedi Master skill. Mission accomplished, he lumbered to his big paws and looked at her expectantly, obviously eager for more exercise.<br><br>She couldn't blame him. He had been endlessly patient during three days of sitting in a booth. He deserved a good, hard run. Too bad her glutes and quads weren't in the mood to cooperate.<br><br>Finally she caught her breath and headed up again, keeping to a slow jog. Despite the muscle aches, more of her tension melted away with each step.<br><br>She used to love running on the beach back in California, with the sea-soaked air in her face and the thud of her jogging shoes on the packed sand and the sheer, unadulterated magnificence of the Pacific always in view.<br><br>No ocean in sight here. Only the towering pines and aspens, the understory of western thimbleberry and wild roses, and the occasional bright flash of a mountain bluebird darting through the bushes.<br><br>She was content with no sound of gulls overhead. She still loved the ocean, without question, and at times yearned to be alone on a beach somewhere while the surf pounded the shore, but somehow this place had become home.<br><br>Who would have expected that a born-and-bred California girl could find this sort of peace and belonging in a little tourist town nestled in the rockies?<br><br>She inhaled a deep, sage-scented breath, more tension easing out of her shoulders with every passing moment. It had been a hectic three days. This was her fourth outdoor arts-and-crafts fair of the season and she had one more scheduled before September. Her crazy idea to set up a booth at summer fairs across Colorado to sell her own wares and those of the other clients of String Fever&#x2014;the bead store in Hope's Crossing where she worked&#x2014;had taken off beyond her wildest dreams.<br><br>She was especially pleased, since all of the beaders participating had agreed to donate a portion of their proceeds to the Layla Parker memorial scholarship fund.<br><br>Layla was the daughter of Evie's good friend Maura McKnight-Parker and she had been killed in April in a tragic accident that had ripped apart the peace of Hope's Crossing and shredded it into tiny pieces.<br><br>Outdoor art-and-crafts fairs were exciting and dynamic, full of color and sound and people. But it was also hard work, especially when she worked by herself. Setting up the awning, arranging the beadwork displays, dealing with customers, running credit cards. All of it posed challenges.<br><br>Over the weekend, she'd had to deal with two shoplifters and the inevitable paperwork that resulted. This Sunday-evening run was exactly what she needed.<br><br>Finally tired, her muscles comfortably burning, she took the fork in the trail that headed back to town, her cross-trainers stirring up little clouds of dirt with every step. She'd forgotten her water bottle in her haste to get up on the cool trail after the drive and suddenly all she could think about was a long, cold drink of water.<br><br>The return trip took her and Jacques down Sweet Laurel road, past some of the small, wood-framed older houses that had been built when the town was raw and new. She saw Caroline Bybee out watering her gorgeous flowers, her wiry gray braids covered by a big, floppy straw hat. Evie waved to her but didn't stop to talk.<br><br>The air smelled of a summer evening, of grilling meat from a barbecue somewhere, onions being cooked in one house she passed, fresh-mown grass at another, all with the undertone of pine and sage from the surrounding mountains.<br><br>By the time she turned at the top of steep Main Street and headed past the storefronts toward her little two-bedroom apartment above String Fever, she was hungry and tired and only wanted to put her feet up for a couple of hours with a good book and a cup of tea.<br><br>String Fever was housed in a two-story brick building that once had been the town's most notorious brothel, back in the days when this particular piece of Colorado was full of rowdy miners. She cut through an alley that opened onto the lovely little fenced garden behind the store, enjoying the sweet glow of the sunset on the weathered brick.<br><br>Jacques gave one sharp bark when she reached the gate into the garden, barely big enough for some flowers, a patch of grass and a table and four chairs where the String Fever employees took breaks or the kids of Claire Bradford&#x2014;soon to be Claire McKnight&#x2014;could hang out and do homework when their mother was working.<br><br>Evie really needed to think about moving into a bigger place where Jacques could have room to run. When she had moved into the apartment above the store, she'd never planned on having a dog, especially not a good-size one like Jacques. She had only intended to foster him for a few weeks as a favor to a friend who volunteered at the animal shelter, but Evie had fallen hard for the big, gentle dog with the incongruously charming poodle fur.<br><br>"Hold on, you crazy dog. You're probably as thirsty as I am. I can let you off your leash in a minute."<br><br>She pushed through the gate, then froze as Jacques instantly barked again at a figure sitting at one of the wrought-iron chairs. The shade of the umbrella obscured his features and her heart gave a well-conditioned little stutter at finding a strange man in her back garden.<br><br>Back in L.A., she probably would have already had one finger on the nozzle of her pepper spray and one on the last "1" in 9-1-1 on her cell phone, just in case.<br><br>Here in Hope's Crossing, when a strange man showed up just before dark, she was definitely still cautious but not panicky. Yet.<br><br>She peered through the beginnings of pearly twilight and suddenly recognized the man&#x2014;and all her alarm bells started clanging even louder. She would much rather face a half dozen knife-wielding criminals out to do her harm than Brodie Thorne.<br><br>"Evening," he said and rose from the table, tall and lean and dark amid the spilling flowerpots set around the pocket garden.<br><br>Jacques strained against the leash, something he didn't normally do. As she wasn't expecting it and hadn't had time to wrap her fingers more tightly around it, the leash slipped through and Jacques used his newfound freedom to rush eagerly toward the strange man.<br><br>The distance was short and she'd barely formed the words of the <em>sit</em> command before the dog reached Brodie. Given her experience with the annoying man, she braced for him to push the dog away with some rude comment about how she couldn't keep her dog under any better control than her life, or something equally disdainful. Instead, he surprised her by scratching the dog between his Lab-shaped ears.<br><br>She didn't want him to be kind to dogs. It was a jarring note in an otherwise unpleasant personality.<br><br>Her relationship with Brodie had gotten off to a rocky start from the moment she'd started an email friendship with his mother nearly three years ago on a beading loop, a friendship that had finally led Evie to Hope's Crossing and String Fever, the store Katherine had opened several years ago and eventually sold to Claire Bradford.<br><br>His mother had become a dear friend. She had offered unending support and love to Evie during a very dark time and Evie adored her. She owed Katherine so much. Being polite to her abrasive son was a small enough thing, especially since Brodie had troubles of his own right now.<br><br>"Sorry. Have you been waiting long?" she asked after an awkward, jerky sort of pause.<br><br>"Ten minutes or so. I was about to leave you a note when I heard you coming down the alley."<br><br>She didn't feel at all prepared to talk to him, especially when she couldn't focus on anything but her thirst. "I'm sorry, but I didn't take my water bottle on my run and I desperately need a drink. Can you give me a minute?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>"Do you want to come up or wait for me down here?"<br><br>"I'll come up."<br><br>On second thought, she should have phrased that differently. <em>How about you wait here where it's safe and stay the heck out of my personal bubble.</em> Alas, too late to rescind the invitation now.<br><br>She led the way up her narrow staircase, aware with each step of the man following closely behind her. She wasn't used to men in this space, she suddenly realized. Yes, she had dated a few times since she'd come to Hope's Crossing, but nothing serious and nobody she would consider inviting up to her personal sanctuary.<br><br>For the most part, her life was surrounded by women. She worked in a bead store, for heaven's sake, a location not usually overflowing with an overabundance of testosterone. If she wanted to date, she was going to have to put a little effort into it. Now that she almost thought she'd begun to finally achieve some level of serenity after the last rough two years, maybe it was time she did something about that.<br><br>If she <em>were</em> to start thinking seriously about entering that particular arena again, she could guarantee with absolute certainty that the words <em>Brodie Thorne</em> and <em>dating</em> would never appear in the same context in her head&#x2014;even though he was gorgeous, if one went for the sexy, dark-haired, buttoned-down businessman.<br><br>Which she so didn't.<br><br>She pulled her house key out of the small zipper pocket on the inside waistband of her leggings and unlocked the door. As soon as it swung open, she winced. She had forgotten the mess she'd left behind when she headed up into the mountains immediately after her return to town&#x2014;the jumble of boxes and bags and suitcases. She really ought to have left Brodie down in the garden with Jacques.<br><br>Brodie raised an eyebrow at the mess&#x2014;or perhaps at her eclectic design tastes, with the mismatched furniture covered in mounds of pillows, the wispy curtains on the windows and the jeweled lampshades she'd created one winter night when she was bored. It was a far cry from her sleek little house in Topanga Canyon or her childhood home, a sprawling mansion in Santa Barbara, but she loved it.<br><br></p><h2>Bride of Pendorric: The Classic Novel of Romantic Suspense</h2><p><p>Favel Farrington meets Roc Pendorric on the idyllic Mediterranean island of Capri, where she was raised and lives with her father.

The book <em>Black Elk Speaks</em> is the most widely-read Native American testimony of the last century and a key work in our understanding of American Indian traditions. In <em>Black Elk, Lakota Visionary</em>, Harry Oldmeadow draws on recently discovered sources and in-depth research to provide a major re-assessment of Black Elk's life and work. The author explores Black Elk's mystical visions, his controversial engagement with Catholicism, and his previously unrecognized attempts to preserve and revive ancestral Sioux beliefs and practices. Oldmeadow's lively and highly readable account also examines the controversies that have surrounded Black Elk and his collaborators, John G. Neihardt and Joseph Epes Brown. Oldmeadow judiciously explains why both <em>Black Elk Speaks</em> and <em>The Sacred Pipe: Black Elk's Account of the Seven Rites of the Oglala Sioux</em> are to be ranked amongst the most profound spiritual documents of the twentieth century.<em> Black Elk, Lakota Visionary</em> will command the attention of every reader who is interested in the American Indians, providing fascinating insights into their ancestral traditions prior to the reservation era, the subsequent destruction and revival of their traditional ways, and the vital lessons which the contemporary world might draw from their spiritual legacy.</p></p><p><p><br></p><p>Harry Oldmeadow was, until his retirement in 2012, Coordinator of Philosophy and Religious Studies at La Trobe University Bendigo. His previous publications include <em>Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions</em>, <em>Frithjof Schuon and the Perennial Philosophy</em>, and <em>Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy</em>.

The author of <em>Iyeska</em>, he is now retired and lives in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>&#x201c;Historian Oldmeadow (The Betrayal of Tradition) skillfully considers the legacy of Black Elk (1863&#x2013;1950), a Lakota holy man who is best known through poet John Neihardt's 1932 biography Black Elk Speaks. Oldmeadow balances contemporary research with presentations of the debate about the facts of Black Elk's life and legacy, including his working relationships with non-Native collaborators who documented his words. . . . Readers interested in Black Elk will find this book an effective synthesis of the scholarship on the mystic's life.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone familiar with Native American history and culture knows Black Elk Speaks, a key piece central to understanding American Indians; but Black Elk, Lakota Visionary takes a different approach in re-assessing Black Elk's life and work, exploring his mystical visions, encounters with Catholicism, and his testament to spiritual realities as they relate to ancestral Sioux belief systems. From interpretations of Black Elk Speaks to how to study his spiritual perspective, Black Elk, Lakota Visionary would best be used as a companion to the classic, offering many viewpoints and insights key to appreciating Black Elk's philosophy and spiritual wisdom.&#x201d; (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Black Elk stands out in bold relief. The dazzling clarity of his visions has incited the spiritually minded everywhere. Thank you Harry Oldmeadow for bringing us closer to the heart of Black Elk and his universal vision.&#x201d; (Kevin Locke, Lakota cultural ambassador, hoop-dancer, traditional storyteller, recording artist, and educator)<br><br>&#x201c;There have been many books written about the Lakota holy man known to the world as Black Elk. However, none have done a more thorough job of assessing the entirety of his life&#x2015;including his far from na�ve engagement with Catholicism&#x2015;than this extremely readable volume by Harry Oldmeadow. I recommend it to anyone interested not only in Black Elk himself but in the stubbornly enduring nature of Native American spiritual life.&#x201d; (Joseph Bruchac, author of Keepers of the Earth and Our Stories Remember)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an extraordinary book. Oldmeadow's groundbreaking interpretation takes Black Elk studies to a profound new level. His nuanced analysis weaves together the many distinctive strands into a cohesive whole&#x2015;one that forms a particularly rich and intimate perspective on the place of Black Elk across disciplines. Black Elk, Lakota Visionary truly completes the hoop and creates a depth and dimensionality that leap off the page.&#x201d; (Wilhelm K. Meya, Executive Director, Lakota Language Consortium)<br><br>&#x201c;This detailed study of Black Elk explores the complex relationships that this sacred healer had with John Neihardt, Joseph Brown, and Frithjof Schuon. Oldmeadow describes the intertwined lives of these men and their controversial collaborations with respect and insight.&#x201d; (John A. Grim, Yale University, author of The Shaman: Patterns of Religious Healing Among the Ojibway Indians)<br><br>&#x201c;A significant contribution to the Black Elk literature. Especially valuable for new information on Joseph Epes Brown and the composition of The Sacred Pipe.&#x201d; (Clyde Holler, author of Black Elk&#x2019;s Religion: The Sun Dance and Lakota Catholicism and editor of The Black Elk Reader)<br><br>&#x201c;Black Elk, Lakota Visionary studies the debate among scholarly specialists as they reconstruct the history behind the life story and Great Vision of the wicasa wakan. Their exchange of views is counterbalanced by an examination of Lakota spirituality in relationship to Western and Eastern religious traditions. Exposure to this discourse will inspire the reader to appreciate the universality of tradition and revelation in Lakota ancestral wisdom and one's place in a world of order with beauty and meaning.&#x201d; (Vivian Arviso Deloria, former Executive Director of Education for the Navajo Nation and Chairperson of the Navajo Nation Women&#x2019;s Commission)<br><br>&#x201c;Black Elk, Lakota Visionary is a wonderful addition to understanding this Oglala holy man's significance in both Native American and United States history. Harry Oldmeadow uses new sources to reassess Black Elk's life, impact, and the controversies with John G. Neihardt, Joseph Epes Brown, and his adoption of Catholicism. . . . Oldmeadow demonstrates how the views of Frithjof Schoun, the pre-eminent Perennialist philosopher, offer a better understanding of Black Elk. All students of Native American history and of Black Elk should be required to read this valuable contribution to the literature.&#x201d; (Raymond Wilson, Fort Hays State University, author of Ohiyesa: Charles Eastman, Santee Sioux and Native Americans in the Twentieth Century)<br><br>&#x201c;Harry Oldmeadow brings together in one volume information that comes from specialists in cultural anthropology as well as rich insights into the human condition from scholars like Mircea Eliade and Frithjof Schuon. Building upon this background, Oldmeadow explores the cultural legacy of Black Elk and the Sioux people. He does so using ordinary language which enables the reader to grasp the rich vision of this holy man and his world.&#x201d; (Richard Davies, Culver Academies, author of Swords at Culver)</p><h2>Reliable Truth: The Validity of the Bible in an Age of Skepticism</h2><p>What do science, history, and logic have to say about the reliability of the Bible?

His achievements were unparalleled&#x2014;he had excelled as leader to his men, founded eighteen new cities, and stamped the face of Greek culture on the ancient East. the myth he created is as potent today as it was in the ancient world.<p>Robin Lane Fox's superb account searches through the mass of conflicting evidence and legend to focus on Alexander as a man of his own time.

She explains everything in language you won&#x2019;t need a psych prof on speed-dial to understand&#x2015;and with the biting dark humor that made <i>Good Manners for Nice People Who Sometimes Say F*ck</i> such a great read. She debunks widely-accepted but scientifically unsupported notions about self-esteem, shame, willpower, and more and demonstrates that: </p><p>- Thinking your way into changing (as so many therapists and self-help books advise) is the most inefficient way to go about it. </p><p>- The mind is bigger than the brain, meaning that your body and your behavior are your gym for turning yourself into the new, confident you. </p><p>- Fear is not just the problem; it&#x2019;s also the solution.</p><p>- By targeting your fears with behavior, you make changes in your brain that reshape your habitual ways of behaving and the emotions that go with them.</p><p>Follow Amy Alkon's groundbreaking advice in <i>Unf*ckology</i>, and eventually, you&#x2019;ll no longer need to act like the new you; you&#x2019;ll <i>become</i> the new you.

In this fast-paced, deeply authentic &#x201c;science-help&#x201d; book, Alkon weaves her own dramatic transformation with the latest science to show you how to live the life you truly want to live. It&#x2019;s time to stop pitying yourself, devaluing yourself, hiding yourself, and all the other things we do to ourselves to avoid being our full selves.

Alkon invented the science-help genre, and this book finds her at the height of her powers. Alkon tackles interpersonal and intrapsychic problems with a voice as sui generis as the problems are universal. It's a master class in making important life changes taught by your hilarious best friend, the one who is as funny as she is smart, and whose radical honesty about her own shortcomings makes her thoroughly unfuckwithable.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Kaja Perina, Editor in Chief of <i>Psychology Today</i></p><br><p>&#x201c;Advice on how to change behavior should be grounded in the science of behavior, but it rarely is.

As more and more colleges turn out spineless snowflakes offended by hand gestures and adjectives, enabled as they are by equally invertebrate faculty and administrators, and major corporations take disciplinary actions against employees who dare to challenge the PC orthodoxy that everyone is equally qualified for every job, we need a major corrective toward a proper understanding of human nature grounded in science, not in postmodernism&#x2019;s dogma that all ideas are equally true. <i>Unf*ckology</i> should be assigned to all students as the textbook for the new science&#x2015;&#x2018;growing a spine&#x2019;&#x2015;and taking personal responsibility for your life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Michael Shermer, Presidential Fellow Chapman University, author of <i>Heavens on Earth</i></p><br><p>&#x201c;You have never read a book like this in your life. Amy Alkon is as funny and as wildly inventive as Dave Barry or PG Wodehouse. Yet she has created what she calls "a science help" book. A book riddled with fascinating research from psychology and neurobiology. A book that shows you and me how to use the results of that psychology in our own lives. And something more. Very few scientists these days are coming up with ideas that pull together the results of wildly diverse disciplines into a new big picture. Very few of today's thinkers give us big ideas. By showing us how to use research on fields like embodiment to change our lives, Amy Alkon has given us two things: new big ideas; and balls-to-the wall hilarity. Let's put that in different words. <i>Unf*ckology</i> is one of the most delightful books you will read in this lifetime. And Amy Alkon has established herself with this book as THE top practitioner of applied science.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Howard Bloom, author of <i>The Lucifer Principle</i> and <i>How I Accidentally Started the Sixties</i></p><br><p>&#x201c;Amy Alkon is such a festive cocktail of funny and brainy! <i>Unf*ckology</i> is hilarious, wise and amazingly useful &#x2018;science-help&#x2019; for the meek to finally get going on inheriting the earth.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Sandra Tsing Loh, host of the syndicated public radio show, The Loh Down On Science; author of <i>The Madwoman in the Volvo</i></p><br><p>&#x201c;In this (very funny) book, Amy Alkon explains how not to be a loser. Being socially anxious and desperate isn't fun. And Amy shows you the science behind self-transformation. No short-cuts or thinking your way out&#x2015;just incremental and targeted action. I found myself nodding throughout because I used a lot of these strategies myself as a socially anxious young person trying to move into an academic career that demanded a great deal of public speaking and interpersonal relationship building. And I appreciated Amy's humor as well&#x2015;taking life too seriously makes changing that much harder.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;W. Keith Campbell, Professor of Psychology, University of Georgia, co-author of <i>The Narcissism Epidemic</i></p><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Unf*ckology</i> is a f*cking good book. The self-help book for people who hate self-help books, <i>Unf*ckology</i> is firmly grounded in empirical research and takes a no-nonsense, no-coddling, no-airy-fairy-BS approach to the subject. It&#x2019;s also very funny. Every page sparkles with Amy&#x2019;s irreverent wit and wisdom. Highly recommended!&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Dr. Steve Stewart-Williams, Assoc. Professor of Psychology, University of Nottingham</p><br><p>Praise for <i>Good Manners for Nice People Who Sometimes Say F*ck</i>:</p><p>&#x201c;Alkon not only tells readers what good manners are but also provides useful suggestions for politely calling offenders' attention to their rudeness. And she does this in a ferociously funny style--it's worth a read for the laughs alone. There is nothing here of the proper arrangement of table setting, nor of how to address a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury; rather Alkon deals with modern problems in interpersonal relationships, such as how civilized people should act when standing in lines, on airplanes, online, and elsewhere.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book is a gem. Hysterically funny and grounded in science, Amy Alkon explains why so many people are rude and how it's possible to be courteous, even if you're foul-mouthed and clueless about etiquette.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dr. Adam Grant, Wharton School professor and New York Times-bestselling author of Give and Take</i></p><p>&#x201c;I can say without reservation that <i>Good Manners For Nice People Who Sometimes Say F*ck</i> is hilarious, consistently entertaining, and, above all, wise. It's Emily Post as a beach read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Charlotte Allen, The Weekly Standard</i></p><p>&#x201c;She is chatty, at times outrageous, but full of ideas about living politely in a society that she says has become too big for our brains to handle. As for Oscar Wilde, at the end of his life is said to have commented: &#x2018;The world was my oyster, but I used the wrong fork.'&#x201d; &#x2015;Moira Hodgson, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;If you're frequently left gasping by the jaw-dropping social ineptitude of your fellow human beings, or you're guilty of being a rude jackass yourself from time to time, this is the book for you. Alkon doesn't suffer fools lightly, but she also has the gentle wisdom to know that each of us plays the role of the fool sometimes. Armed with fascinating science, great humor, and a preternatural bullshit detector for a mind, she shoots from the hip &#x2013; and you'll be damn glad she does, too.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dr. Jesse Bering, Associate Professor of Science Communication and author of Perv</p><p>&#x201c;Contradiction is part of what makes Ms. Alkon so captivating. Perhaps the biggest contradiction: The hisser can also be utterly lovely.&#x201d; &#x2015;Brooks Barnes, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Although the subject matter should be enough to hold your attention, it is primarily Amy's ability to turn a phrase that makes the book such a good ride. Her section headings (e.g., 'Dating is War,' 'Murder-Suicide and Other Forms of Diplomacy,' 'The Tragedy of the Asshole in the Commons') make it impossible to put the book down and get back to work without reading <i>just one more</i> section. I highly recommend this book.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dr. Frank McAndrew, <i>Evolutionary Psychology journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this comprehensive, science-based, easy-to-read, and hilarious book, Alkon looks at where our rudeness comes from and provides tangible ways for all of us to deal with it.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dr. Jennifer Verdolin, <i>Psychology Today</i></p><p>&#x201c;One of '11 Smart Books You Should Read This Summer'&#x201d; &#x2015;Sam McNerney, <i>250Words.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;This crazy redhead is on to something. Her pink Rambler story alone is worth the price of the book.&#x201d; &#x2015;Elmore Leonard on <i>I See Rude People</i></p><p>&#x201c;Amy Alkon is intellectually promiscuous&#x2015;and funny as hell.&#x201d; &#x2015;Howard Bloom, paleopsychologist and author of The Lucifer Principle, on<i> I See Rude People</i></p><p>&#x201c;Seriously great book. Alkon is smart and savvy and funny as hell. Where Hannibal the Cannibal only ate the rude, Alkon stands up to them with the sort of glorious panache that sometimes makes you want to stand and cheer.&#x201d; &#x2015;David Middleton, <i>January Magazine on I See Rude People</i></p><p>&#x201c;Alkon turns reporting on findings in evolutionary psychology into an art form. She scans the research horizon for fascinating new results. Though relentless in her skepticism, she is keenly attuned to findings that are both solid and suggestive. (The world lost a great analyst when Alkon turned away from academic research.) In her hands, all this research turns into practical advice for how ordinary people can live better lives. Alkon may be, as the LA Weekly put it, 'Miss Manners With Fangs,' but she is perhaps better characterized as the offspring of Charles Darwin and Dorothy Parker. We academics can all take a lesson from her ability to redefine academic turf in terms 'the ordinary person' can both understand and enjoy.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dr. Barbara Oakley, Oakland University</p></p><h2>Echoes: The Saga Anthology of Ghost Stories</h2><p><b>The essential collection of beloved ghost stories, compiled by the editor who helped define the genre&#x2014;including stories from award-winning, bestselling authors such as Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Hoffman, Seanan McGuire, and Paul Tremblay.</b><br><br>Everyone loves a good ghost story, especially Ellen Datlow&#x2014;the most lauded editor in short works of supernatural suspense and dark fantasy. <i>The Saga Anthology of Ghost Stories</i> is her definitive collection of ghost stories.<br> <br>These twenty-nine stories, including all new works from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling authors Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Hoffman, Seanan McGuire, and Paul Tremblay, span from the traditional to the eclectic, from the mainstream to the literary, from pure fantasy to the bizarrely supernatural.

Like a John-Hughes-Hollywood-Eighties-movie-typecast loser. Maybe we all imagine ourselves as being that special kind of ugly duckling, with the truth being too scary to contemplate: Maybe I was someone&#x2019;s bully or I was the kid who egged on the bullies screaming, &#x201c;Sweep the leg,&#x201d; or maybe I was lower than the Hughes loser, someone who would never be shown in a movie.<br> <br>When I think of who I was all those years ago, I&#x2019;m both embarrassed and look-at-what-I&#x2019;ve-become proud, as though the distance spanned between those two me&#x2019;s can only be measured in light-years. That distance is a lie, of course, though perhaps necessary to justify perceived successes and mollify the disappointments and failures. That thirteen-year-old me is still there inside: the socially awkward one who wouldn&#x2019;t find a group he belonged to until college; the one who watched way too much TV and listened to records while lying on the floor with the speakers tented over his head; the one who was afraid of the Jaws shark appearing in any body of water, Christopher Lee vampires, the dark in his closet and under the bed, and the blinding flash of a nuclear bomb. That kid is all-too-frighteningly retrievable at times.<br> <br>Now he&#x2019;s here in a more tangible form. He&#x2019;s in the contents of a weathered cardboard box sitting like a toadstool on my kitchen counter. Mom inexplicably plopped this time capsule in my lap on her way out the door after an impromptu visit. When I asked for an explanation, she said she thought I should have it. I pressed her for more of the why and she said, &#x201c;Well, because it&#x2019;s yours. It&#x2019;s your stuff,&#x201d; as though she was weary of the burden of having had to keep it for all those years.<br> <br>Catherine is visiting her parents on the Cape and she took our daughter Izzy with her. I stayed home to finish edits (which remain stubbornly unfinished) on a manuscript that was due last week. Catherine and Izzy would&#x2019;ve torn through this box-of-me right away and laughed themselves silly at the old photos of my stick figure body and my map of freckles and crooked teeth, the collection of crayon renderings of dinosaurs with small heads and ludicrously large bodies, and the fourth grade current events project on Ronald Reagan for which I&#x2019;d earned a disappointing C+ and a demoralizing teacher comment of Too messy. And I would&#x2019;ve reveled in their attention, their warm spotlight shining on who I was and who I&#x2019;ve become.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t find it until my second pass through the box, which seems impossible as I took care to peel old pictures apart and handle everything delicately, as one might handle ancient parchments. That second pass occurred two hours after the first, and there was a pizza and multiple beers and no edits between.<br> <br>The drawing that I don&#x2019;t remember saving was there at the bottom of the box, framed by the cardboard and its interior darkness. I thought I&#x2019;d forgotten it; I know I never had.<br> <br>The initial discovery was more confounding than dread inducing, but hours have passed and now it&#x2019;s late and it&#x2019;s dark. I have every light on in the house, which only makes the dark outside even darker. I am alone and I am on alert and I feel time creeping forward. (Time doesn&#x2019;t run out; it continues forward and it continues without you.) I do not sit in any one room for longer than five minutes. I pass through the lower level of the house as quietly as I can, like an omniscient, emotionally distant narrator, which I am not. On the TV is a baseball game that I don&#x2019;t care about, blaring at full volume. I consider going to my car and driving to my in-laws&#x2019; on the Cape, which would be ridiculous as I wouldn&#x2019;t arrive until well after midnight and Catherine and Izzy are coming home tomorrow morning.<br> <br>Would it be so ridiculous?<br> <br>Tomorrow, when my family returns home and the windows are open and the sunlight is as warm as a promise, I will join them in laughing at me. But it is not tomorrow and they are not here.<br> <br>I am glad they&#x2019;re not here. They would&#x2019;ve found the drawing before I did.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I rode my bicycle all over Beverly, Massachusetts, the summer of 1984. I didn&#x2019;t have a BMX bike with thick, knobby tires made for ramps and wheelies and chewing up and spitting out dirt and pavement. Mine was a dinged up, used-to-belong-to-my-dad ten-speed, and the only things skinnier and balder than the tires were my arms and legs. On my rides I always made sure to rattle by Kelly Bishop&#x2019;s house on the off-off-chance I&#x2019;d find her in her front yard. Doing what? Who knows. But in those fantasies she waved or nodded at me. She would ask what I was doing and I&#x2019;d tell her all nonchalant-like that I was heading back to my house, even though she&#x2019;d have to know her dead-end street wasn&#x2019;t exactly on my way home. Pesky details were worked out or inconsequential in fantasies, of course.<br> <br>One afternoon it seemed part of my fantasy was coming true when Kelly and her little sister were at the end of their long driveway, sitting at a small fold-up table with a pitcher of lemonade. I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to stop or slow down or even make more than glancing eye contact. I had no money for lemonade, therefore I had no reason to stop. Kelly shouted at me as I rolled by. Her greeting wasn&#x2019;t a Hey there or even a Hi, but instead, &#x201c;Buy some lemonade or we&#x2019;ll pop your tires!&#x201d;<br> <br>After twenty-four hours of hopeful and fearful Should I or shouldn&#x2019;t I?, I went back the next day with a pocket full of quarters. Kelly was again stationed at the end of her driveway. My breaks squealed as I jerked to an abrupt and uncoordinated stop. My rusted kickstand screamed You&#x2019;re really doing this? embarrassment. The girls didn&#x2019;t say anything and watched my approach with a mix of disinterest and what I imagined to be the look I gave ants before I squashed them.<br> <br>They sat at the same table setup as the previous day but there was no pitcher of lemonade. Never afraid to state the obvious, I said, &#x201c;So, um, no lemonade today?&#x201d; The fifty cents clutched in my sweaty hand might as well have melted.<br> <br>Kelly said, &#x201c;Lemonade was yesterday. Can&#x2019;t you read the sign?&#x201d; She sat slumped in her beach chair, a full body eye roll, and her long, tanned legs spilled out from under the table and the white poster-board sign taped to the front. She wore a red Coke T-shirt. Her chestnut brown hair was pulled into a side-high ponytail, held up by a black scrunchie. Kelly was clearly well into her pubescent physical transformation, whereas I was still a boy, without even a shadow of hair under my armpits.<br> <br>Kelly&#x2019;s little sister, with the bowl-cut mop of dirty blond hair, was going to be in second grade. I didn&#x2019;t know her name and was too nervous to ask. She covered her mouth, fake laughed, and wobbled like a penguin in her unstable chair. That she might topple into the table or to the blacktop didn&#x2019;t seem to bother Kelly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re supposed to be the smart one, Paul,&#x201d; Kelly added.<br> <br>&#x201c;Heh, yeah, sorry.&#x201d; I left the quarters in my pocket to hide their shame and adjusted my blue gym shorts; they were too short, even for the who-wears-short-shorts Eighties. I tried to fill the chest of my NBA Champs Celtics T-shirt with deep breaths, but only managed to stir a weak ripple in the green cloth.<br> <br>Their updated sign read:<br> <br>ICE COLD LEMONDADE 25� HAUNTED HOUSE TOUR: 1 PER PERSON<br> <br>Seemed straightforward enough but I didn&#x2019;t know what to make of it. I feared it was some kind of a joke or prank. Were Rick or Winston or other jerks hiding close by to jump out and pants me? I thought about hopping back on my bike and getting the hell out before I did something epically cringeworthy Kelly would later describe in detail to all her friends and by proxy the entire soon-to-be seventh grade class.<br> <br>Kelly asked, &#x201c;Do you want a tour of our creepy old house or not?&#x201d;<br> <br>I stammered and I sweated. I remember sweating a lot.<br> <br>Kelly told me the lemonade stand thing was boring and that her new haunted-house-tour idea was genius. I would be their first to go on the tour so I&#x2019;d be helping them out. She said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll even only charge you half price. Be a pal, Paulie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Was Kelly Bishop inviting me into her house? Was she making fun of me? The &#x201c;be a pal&#x201d; bit sounded like a joke and felt like a joke. I looked around the front yard, spying between the tall front hedges, looking for the ambush. I decided I didn&#x2019;t care, and said, &#x201c;Okay, yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>The little sister shouted, &#x201c;One dollar,&#x201d; and held out an open hand.<br> <br>Kelly corrected her. &#x201c;I said &#x2018;half price.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s half?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fifty cents.&#x201d;<br> <br>Little sis shouted, &#x201c;Fifty cents!&#x201d; with her hand still out.<br> <br>I paid, happy to be giving the sweaty quarters to her and not Kelly.<br> <br>I asked, &#x201c;Is it scary, I mean, supposed to be scary?&#x201d; I tried smiling bravely. I wasn&#x2019;t brave. I still slept with my door open and the hallway light on. My smile was pretend brave, and it wasn&#x2019;t much of a smile as I tried not to show off my mouth of metal braces, the elastics on either side mercifully no longer necessary as of three weeks ago.<br> <br>Kelly stood and said, &#x201c;Terrifying. You&#x2019;ll wet yourself and be sucking your thumb for a week.&#x201d; She whacked her sister on the shoulder and commanded, &#x201c;Go. You have one minute to be ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need a minute.&#x201d; She bounced across the lawn onto the porch and slammed the front door closed behind her.<br> <br>Kelly flipped through a stack of note cards. She said she hadn&#x2019;t memorized the script yet but she would eventually.<br> <br>I followed her down the driveway to the house I never thought of as scary or creepy, but now that it had the word haunted attached to it, even in jest . . . it was kind of creepy. The only three-family home in the neighborhood, it looked impossibly tall from up close. And it was old, worn out&#x2014;the white paint peeling and flaking away. Its stone and mortar foundation appeared crooked. The windows were tall and thin and impenetrable. The small front porch had two skeletal posts holding up a warped overhang that could come crashing down at any second.<br> <br>We walked up the stairs to the porch, and the wood felt soft under my feet. Kelly was flipping through her note cards and held the front screen door open for me with a jutted out hip. I scooted by, holding my breath, careful to not accidentally brush against her.<br> <br>The cramped front hallway/foyer was crowded with bikes and shovels and smelled like wet leaves. A poorly lit staircase curled up to the right. Kelly told me that the tour finishes on the second floor, and we weren&#x2019;t allowed all the way upstairs to the third, and that she had written &#x201c;1 Per Person&#x201d; on the sign so that no pervs would try for repeat tours since she and her sister were home by themselves.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your parents aren&#x2019;t home?&#x201d; My voice cracked, as if on cue.<br> <br>If Kelly answered with a nod of the head, I didn&#x2019;t see it. She reached across me, opened the door to my left, and said, &#x201c;Welcome to House Black, the most haunted house on the North Shore.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kelly put one hand between my shoulder blades and pushed me inside to a darkened kitchen. The linoleum was sandy, gritty, under my shuffling sneakers. The room smelled of dust and pennies. The shapes of the table, chairs, and appliances were sleeping animals. From somewhere on this first floor, her sister gave a witchy laugh. It was muffled, and I remember thinking it sounded like she was inside the walls.<br> <br>Kelly carefully narrated: The house was built in the 1700s by a man named Robert or Reginald Black, a merchant sailor who was gone for months at a time. His wife, Denise, would dutifully wait for him in the kitchen. After all the years of his leaving, Denise was driven mad by a lonely heart and she wouldn&#x2019;t go anywhere else in the house but the kitchen until he returned home. She slept sitting in a wooden chair and washed herself in the kitchen sink. Years passed like this. Mr. Black was to take one final trip before retiring but Mrs. Black had had enough. As he ate his farewell breakfast she smashed him over the head with an iron skillet until he was dead. Mrs. Black then stuffed her husband&#x2019;s body into the oven.<br> <br>The kitchen&#x2019;s overhead light, a dirty yellow fixture, flashed on. I saw a little hand leave the switch and disappear behind a door across the room from me. On top of the oven was a cast iron, black skillet. Little sis flashed her arm back into the room and turned out the light.<br> <br>Kelly loomed over me (she was at least three inches taller) and said that this was not the same oven, and everyone who ever lived here has tried getting a new one, but you can still sometimes hear Mr. Black clanging around inside.<br> <br>The oven door dropped open with a metal scream, like when an ironing board&#x2019;s legs were pried opened.<br> <br>I jumped backward and knocked into the kitchen table.<br> <br>Kelly hissed, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s too hard, be careful! You&#x2019;re gonna rip the oven door off!&#x201d;<br> <br>Little sis dashed into the room and I could see in her hands a ball of fishing line, which was tethered to the oven door handle.<br> <br>Kelly asked me what I thought of the tour opener, if I found it satisfactory. I swear that is the phrasing she used.<br> <br>Mortified that I&#x2019;d literally jumped and sure that she could hear my heart rabbiting in my chest, I mumbled, &#x201c;Yeah, that was good.&#x201d;<br> <br>The tour moved on throughout the darkened first floor. All the see-through lace curtains were drawn, and either Kelly or little sis would turn a room&#x2019;s light on and off during Kelly&#x2019;s readings. Most of the stories featured the hapless descendants of the Blacks. The dining room&#x2019;s story was unremarkable as was the story for the living room, which was the largest room on the first floor. I&#x2019;d begun to lose focus, and let my mind wander to Kelly and what she was like when her parents were home, and then, perhaps oddly, what her parents were like, and if they were like mine. My dad had recently moved from the Parker Brothers factory to managing one of their warehouses, and Mom worked part-time as a bank teller. I wondered what Kelly&#x2019;s parents did for work and if they sat in the kitchen and discussed their money problems too. Were her parents kind? Were they too kind? Were they overbearing or unreasonable? Were they perpetually distracted? Did they argue? Were they cold? Were they cruel? I still wonder these things about everyone else&#x2019;s parents.<br> <br>Kelly did not take me into her parents&#x2019; bedroom, saying simply, &#x201c;Under construction,&#x201d; as we passed by the closed door.<br> <br>I suggested that she make up a story about something or someone terrible kept hidden behind the door.<br> <br>Kelly to this point had kept her nose in her script cards and jotted down notes with a pencil when not watching for my reaction. Her head snapped up at me and she said, &#x201c;None of these are made-up stories, Paul.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was another bedroom, the one directly off the kitchen, and it was being used as an office/sitting room. There was a desk and bookcases tracing the wall&#x2019;s boundaries. The walls were covered in brownish-yellow wallpaper and the circular throw rug was dark too; I don&#x2019;t remember the colors. It&#x2019;s as though color didn&#x2019;t exist there. The room was sepia, like a memory. In the middle of the room was a rolling chair, and on the chair was a form covered by a white sheet.<br> <br>Kelly had to coax me into the room.

Reframation is a passionate manifesto, calling followers of Jesus to reframe and reenchant our worldview, enlarging our perception of God and gospel. It&#39;s an invitation to stretch our minds, expand our hearts, and awaken ourselves and those around us to the grand story of God. Rooted in Scripture, and drawing on poetry, literature, the arts, philosophy, and pop culture, Reframation refuses to settle for pious platitudes, and appeals to each and every one of us to experience and articulate the good news narrative in ways that resonate with the spiritual hunger and longings of those in our contemporary culture.</p><p>&nbsp;Hirsch and Nelson bring to this book a wide reading and a deep pondering. They mobilize a rich learning to offer a telling critique of our present disenchanted world. Happily they go beyond expos� to offer a thick direction for reenchantment. They appeal to narrative (whereby we may speak and hear of one-off impossibilities), imagination (that opens new worlds beyond our control), and repentance (that may yield fresh reframing.)

In this collection of letters, a finalist for the PEN USA translation award, the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and Lou Andreas-Salom�, a writer and intellectual fourteen years his senior, pen a relationship that spans thirty years and shifting boundaries: as lovers, as mentor and prot�g�, and as deep personal and literary allies.</p><p><p><strong>RAINER MARIA RILKE</strong> (1875&#x2013;1926) is one of the greatest poets who ever wrote in the German language.

He is a professor at Rice University and lives in Houston, Texas.</p>With more than twenty-five years of correspondence between "two old scribblers," world-renowned writer Rainer Maria Rilke and his sounding-board, one-time lover, friend and mentor Lou Andreas-Salome, Snow and Winkler have gathered an intimate portrait of an important literary relationship. Unfortunately, a falling-out in 1901 led Andreas-Salome to demand Rilke burn all the letters she had sent to him, which he obliged, making it difficult, in the beginning, to understand the nuance of their romance. As a poet courting an older, married woman, Rilke's early letters are fervid and eager, full of overblown romantic revelations: "all the roses in the world bloom for you and by means of you ... and only through an act of royal condescension do you maintain the pretense that they aren't really yours and allow Spring to keep them." Later, when Andreas-Salome's voice chimes in, the pair settle into a more introspective exchange, one frequently troubled by the insecure poet's vascillation between elation and despondency. Translated into elegant but stiff prose by Snow and Winkler, professors at Rice University who translated Rilke's Diaries of a Young Poet, this work is lustrous and illuminating, a perfect companion for fans of Rilke's poetry and the literary world of the early 20th century. 16 pages of illustrations. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Falling in love with Jesus. Mission trips. Wearing jeans and T-shirts to church. Spiritual searching and church hopping. Faith-based political activism. Seeker-sensitive outreach. These now-commonplace elements of American church life all began as innovative ways to reach young people, yet they have gradually become accepted as important parts of a spiritual ideal for all ages. What on earth has happened?<br><br> In The <i>Juvenilization of American Christianity</i> Thomas Bergler traces the way in which, over seventy-five years, youth ministries have breathed new vitality into four major American church traditions -- African American, Evangelical, Mainline Protestant, and Roman Catholic. Bergler shows too how this "juvenilization" of churches has led to widespread spiritual immaturity, consumerism, and self-centeredness, popularizing a feel-good faith with neither intergenerational community nor theological literacy. Bergler&#x2019;s critique further offers constructive suggestions for taming juvenilization.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>Thomas E.

This audacious novel is a brilliant (and literal) head trip of a book that brings us into the wildly active, albeit coma-beset, mind of Roy Strang, whose hallucinatory quest to eradicate the evil predator/scavenger marabou stork keeps being interrupted by grisly memories of the social and family dysfunction that brought him to this state. It is the sort of lethally funny cocktail of pathos, violence, and outrageous hilarity that only Irvine Welsh can pull off.</p><p>Irvine Welsh is the best-selling author of Trainspotting, Ecstasy, Glue, Porno, Filth, Marabou Stork Nightmares, The Acid House, Skagboys, and, most recently, A Decent Ride. He currently lives in Chicago. T2 Trainspotting was first published as Porno.When the narrator's polished account of a surreal African safari suddenly gives way to an Edinburgh soccer thug's obscenity-laced vernacular, it's clear that Welsh's unrelenting exploration of the Scottish underclass has undergone an unexpected transmutation. The LSD and heroin of the author's previous works (a story collection, The Acid House; a novel, Trainspotting) have changed into the hospital-bed fantasies and hallucinations of the comatose Roy Strang, but the flashbacked details of his damaged childhood and hooligan's career are as raw and despairing as any Welsh has depicted before. To escape from a bleak public-housing existence, Roy's "genetic disaster" of a dysfunctional family emigrates from the U.K. to South Africa ("Sooth Efrikay" in the novel's endemic Scotch), where young Roy encounters a right-wing, child-molesting uncle as well as the Marabou Stork, a vicious predator-scavenger. Returning home, Roy graduates from abused to abuser. Welsh expertly handles these realistically brutal episodes, from Roy's knifing of a schoolmate just to establish himself, through adult pub-wrecking. Then there's the harrowing secret Roy is trying to repress by imagining, amid ludicrously distracting family visits, a fantasy quest to eradicate the flamingo-killing Stork-"the personification of all this badness... the badness in me." With as good an ear for Scotch as James Kelman and as twisted an imagination as Will Self, Welsh makes his novelist's debut stateside with a darkly hilarious, deeply disturbing but ultimately compassionate book.

Martin Mosebach offers up a compelling defense of the traditional Roman Rite and a searing critique of the postconciliar liturgical reform through which ancient rites were profaned by tone-deaf modernizers&#x2014;and thus a once-flourishing religion gutted by banal innovations. For Mosebach, the only coherent solution to this crisis is a wholehearted return to the old Latin liturgy in its tightly-woven symbolic texture of prayer and chant, gesture and ceremonial&#x2014;the rich heritage of its &#x201c;mystic benedictions&#x201d; (Trent). Long out of print, this revised and expanded edition will be the more welcome for its six new chapters and foreword by eminent moral philosopher Robert Spaemann.</p> <p>&#x201c;Martin Mosebach has identified the central issue of the debate about liturgical reform, which is really a debate about the nature and mission of the Church. <i>The Heresy of Formlessness</i> is one of the most important books on the liturgy to be published in the last half-century, and among those certainly the most accessible.

But now internal rebellion threatens the stability of the mighty Republic. An aging, ailing Gaius Marius, heralded conqueror of Germany and Numidia, longs for that which was prophesied many years before: an unprecedented seventh consulship of Rome. It is a prize to be won only through treachery and with blood, pitting Marius against a new generation of assassins, power-seekers, and Senate intriguers&#x2014;and setting him at odds with the ambitious, tormented Lucius Cornelius Sulla, once Marius's most trusted right-hand man, now his most dangerous rival.</p></p><p><p>Colleen McCullough is the author of <em>The Thorn Birds, Tim, An Indecent Obsession, A Creed for the Third Millennium, The Ladies of Missalonghi, The First Man in Rome, The Grass Crown, Fortune's Favorites, Caesar's Women, Caesar</em>, and other novels. She lives with her husband on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific.</p>Volume two of McCullough's triumphant Roman series. The First in Rome (1990) initiated the chronicle of the edgy partnership of new-man-in-Rome Gaius Marius and aristocrat Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the German wars. Here, the calamitous last hurrah of one and the violent pinnacle acts of the other twist through years of Italian wars, expeditions into Asia Minor, domestic trials and brief happinesses, terrible cruelties, and politics, always politics, in which sectors, families, and the famous fight for power--by diplomacy, manipulation, alliances, or the simple art of murder. By now (roughly 80's and 90's B.C.) Marius is in his 60s and escaping a ``dull'' Rome to scout Asia Minor and sniff out the purposes of the barbarian king Mithridates of Pontus. The king will be faced down, and, some years later, Sulla, in a spectacular expedition over the Euphrates, will face him down again. Meanwhile, in the Senate there is a movement to enfranchise the sophisticated neighboring Italians, a movement snapped off by an assassination and a polarizing of ruling powers--and, inevitably, there's war. It is the overwhelming victory over one of the Italian tribes that brings Sulla his highest honor (the Grass Crown). Surely he is now equal to the great general Marius, now crippled by a stroke and attended by the boy Gaius Julius Caesar Junior, his wife's nephew. (Yep. The very same.) Marius intends to fulfill an old prophecy- -that he will be elected Consul for a seventh time. The inevitable conflict between Marius and Sulla explodes during an ongoing battle to dilute the power of the Senate elite. There will be a march on an unarmed Rome, screaming grabs for ascendance from an unhinged, dying Marius, and a raving Sulla, plus bloody deaths...and deaths...and deaths. Again, magnificent portraits of real beings. And, again, gamey politics, bright talk, great scenery, and gore. With glossary and maps.

The novel begins with a bang as Reacher rescues Beck's son from a staged kidnapping in order to get close to his father--and trace the connection between Beck and Quinn, a former army intelligence officer who tried to sell blueprints of a secret weapon to Iraq but was murdered before he could pull it off. Or so Reacher thinks, until he spots Quinn in the crowd at a concert in Boston. As usual, Child ratchets up the tension and keeps the reader in suspense until the last page, although his enigmatic hero hardly ever seems to break a sweat.

Now, in his first collection of short fiction in more than a decade, McCann charts the territory of chance, and the profound and intimate consequences of even our smallest moments.<br><br> <b><i>&#x201c;As it was, it was like being set down in the best of poems, carried into a cold landscape, blindfolded, turned around, unblindfolded, forced, then, to invent new ways of seeing.&#x201d;</i></b><br><br> In the exuberant title novella, a retired judge reflects on his life&#x2019;s work, unaware as he goes about his daily routines that this particular morning will be his last. In &#x201c;Sh&#x2019;khol,&#x201d; a mother spending Christmas alone with her son confronts the unthinkable when he disappears while swimming off the coast near their home in Ireland. In &#x201c;Treaty,&#x201d; an elderly nun catches a snippet of a news report in which it is revealed that the man who once kidnapped and brutalized her is alive, masquerading as an agent of peace.

With unsurpassed empathy for his characters and their inner lives, Colum McCann forges from their stories a profound tribute to our search for meaning and grace. The collection is a rumination on the power of storytelling in a world where language and memory can sometimes falter, but in the end do not fail us, and a contemplation of the healing power of literature.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Thirteen Ways of Looking</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Extraordinary . . . incandescent.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;The irreducible mystery of human experience ties this small collection together, and in each of these stories McCann explores that theme in some strikingly effective ways. . . .

You don&#x2019;t have to know, for example, that the title of the collection and of the novella inside, comes from a Wallace Stevens poem; read straightforwardly, the title story is a brilliant evocation on its own, a sardonic and touching account of the last day in the life of an ailing New York judge, who reminisces passionately about his late wife and sees all too clearly the boor of a son they&#x2019;ve created. And even though there&#x2019;s a bit of a whodunit in this tale &#x2013; Judge Mendelssohn dies mysteriously on the street outside the restaurant he frequents for lunch&#x2013;the pleasure is as much in the language as in the plot. McCann can&#x2019;t resist some refined word play (&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t put all your begs in one ask-it&#x201d;) and the occasional, ultra-descriptive insult (&#x201c;His wife is a pile-up of peroxide.) But there&#x2019;s a lot of heart here, too, as well as in the other three stories in the collection. McCann says in his Author&#x2019;s Notes that all four pieces were written in reaction to &#x201c;an incident that occurred in New Haven, Connecticut&#x201d; when the author was knocked unconscious by a stranger as he went to the aid of a woman in distress. Opining that, no matter what, &#x201c;every word we write is autobiographical,&#x201d; McCann has found a way to plumb, in fiction, the real life violence all around us and the way each of us copes, or not. <em> &#x2013; Sara Nelson</em></p><b>Colum McCann</b> is the internationally bestselling author of the novels <i>TransAtlantic, Let the Great World Spin, Zoli, Dancer, This Side of Brightness, </i>and<i> Songdogs,</i> as well as two critically acclaimed story collections.

Lansdale</h2><p>Godzilla&#x2019;s in a twelve-step program. A soul-sucking Mummy stalks Elvis and John F. Kennedy. Joe Bob Briggs has a moral dilemma: If your girlfriend turns zombie on you, what do you do?<br><br>And that&#x2019;s the tame stuff.<br><br>In this red-hot collection from world-champion Mojo storyteller Joe R. Lansdale, you&#x2019;ll find his best, most outrageous stories. The high priest of Texan weirdness does it all: horror, mystery, satire, suspense, and even Westerns. Prepare to be offended, shocked, and cackling like a crazed redneck.<br><br>Featuring five Bram Stoker Award winning stories, this career retrospective contains some of Lansdale&#x2019;s rarer work, his nonfiction forays into drive-in theaters and B-movies, and the novella <i>Bubba Ho-Tep</i>, later made into a cult-classic major motion picture.<br><br>Come on in the weirdness is fine.</p><p>Joe R. Lansdale is the author of more than thirty novels, including the Edgar Award&#x2013;winning Hap and Leonard mystery series (<i>Mucho Mojo</i>, <i>Two Bear Mambo</i>) and the New York Times Notable Book <i>The Bottoms</i>. More than two hundred of his stories have appeared in such outlets as <i>Tales From the Crypt</i> and <i>Pulphouse</i>, and his work has been adapted for <i>The Twilight Zone</i> and <i>Masters of Horror</i>. Lansdale has written several graphic novels, including <i>Batman</i> and <i>Fantastic Four</i>. He is a tenth-degree black belt and the founder of the Shen Chuan martial art.Indisputably one of horror&#x2019;s most revered craftsmen, with more than 30 novels and hundreds of stories to his credit, Lansdale sports an idiosyncratic, endearingly profane style. Where else but in a Lansdale story would one find Godzilla in a 12-step program tailored to oversized monsters, or an octogenarian Elvis, confined to a bed in the Shady Grove Convalescent Home, facing down a soul-eating Egyptian mummy? Both tales are in this handpicked best-of collection, about which his fans could only object that its total of 16 stories is far too small. Lansdale&#x2019;s favored themes run from zombies to vampire hunters to drive-in theaters, and his storytelling encompasses everything from gross-out horror to satire. For the record, &#x201c;Mad Dog Summer,&#x201d; about a brother and sister&#x2019;s tense encounter with a backwoods creature during the Depression, is worth the price of the volume all by itself; and as a bonus attraction, Lansdale includes a rambling, autobiographical essay describing his East Texas boyhood and the many influences on his fiction, from comics to fantasy. --Carl Hays</p><h2>Romans 3:20-4:25 (Romans (Banner of Truth))</h2><p>In this volume the preacher moves step by step through the massive reasoning of the Apostle Paul on atonement and justification, yet the detail of the exposition does not stand in the way of a clear view of the whole, and the reader is constantly shown how every section fits in the theme of God&#39;s complete plan of salvation.</p><p>Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981) was born in Wales.

This brilliantly clear and gratifyingly concise treatment of the ancient Greek discipline identifies the illogical in everything from street signs to tax forms. Complete with puzzles you can try yourself, <em>Logic Made Easy</em> invites readers to identify and ultimately remedy logical slips in everyday life. Designed with dozens of visual examples, the book guides you through those hair-raising times when logic is at odds with our language and common sense. <em>Logic Made Easy</em> is indeed one of those rare books that will actually make you a more logical human being. 36 illustrations.</p><p>Deborah J. Bennet is the author of Randomness and teaches mathematics at New Jersey City University in Jersey City.In this compact, fluently written survey leavened with humor, New Jersey mathematics professor Bennett (<i>Randomness</i>) entertains as she instructs, focusing on?"the barriers we face in trying to communicate logically with each other." The author covers the ancient Greeks (the Greek word <i>logos</i> means "knowledge"), then such giants as Leibniz and Newton, who helped rescue the study of logic from classical languages, finally modern mathematicians and philosophers like Whitehead and Russell. In discussing topics like syllogisms, she uses tables and diagrams that shouldn't daunt anyone with a firm foundation in high school algebra and geometry. The book's most interesting chapter explains why <i>if</i> is perhaps the most problematical word in any verbal proposition. Everyone, including the hopelessly innumerate, will find Bennett's lessons in the tricks of speech invaluable, particularly in this election year. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Eliot: Collected and Uncollected Poems (Volume 1)</h2><p><p>Winner of the CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title of the Choice ACRL, Pegasus Award for Criticism of the Poetry Magazine</p><p>This critical edition of T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s <i>Poems </i>establishes a new text of the <i>Collected Poems 1909&#x2013;1962</i>, rectifying accidental omissions and errors that have crept in during the century since Eliot&#x2019;s astonishing debut, "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock." As well as the masterpieces, the edition contains the poems of Eliot&#x2019;s youth, which were rediscovered only decades later, others that circulated privately during his lifetime, and love poems from his final years, written for his wife Valerie Eliot.</p><p>Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue have provided a commentary that illuminates the imaginative life of each poem. Calling upon Eliot&#x2019;s critical writings, as well as his drafts, letters, and other original materials, they illustrate not only the breadth of Eliot&#x2019;s interests and the range of his writings, but how it was that the author of "Gerontion" came to write "Triumphal March" and then <i>Four Quartets</i>. Thanks to the family and friends who recognized Eliot&#x2019;s genius and preserved his writings from an early age, the archival record is exceptionally complete, enabling us to follow in unique detail the progress of a mind that never ceased exploring.</p><p>This first volume respects Eliot&#x2019;s decisions by opening with his <i>Collected Poems 1909&#x2013;1962</i> as he arranged and issued it, shortly before his death fifty years ago. This is followed by poems uncollected but either written for or suitable for publication, and by a new reading text of the drafts of <i>The Waste Land</i>. The volume concludes with the commentary on all of these poems.</p><p>The second volume opens with the two books of verse of other kinds that Eliot issued, <i>Old Possum&#x2019;s Book of Practical Cats</i> and his translation of St.-John Perse&#x2019;s <i>Anabase</i>. Different again are the verses informal, improper, or clubmanlike. Each of these sections has its own commentary. Finally, pertaining to the entire edition, there is a textual history that contains not only variants from all known drafts and the many printings but also extended passages amounting to hundreds of lines of compelling verse.</p><p>"The more we know of Eliot, the better."&#x2015;Ezra Pound</p></p><p><p>A monumental event in Eliot scholarship.</p><p><b>Thomas Stearns Eliot </b>was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888.

It explores the broad appeal of this new vision and offers a brief history of its development. The book presents a theoretical foundation for the principles and values of restorative justice and develops its four cornerpost ideas of encounter, amends, inclusion and reintegration. After exploring how restorative justice ideas and values may be integrated into policy and practice, it presents a series of key issues commonly raised about restorative justice, summarizing various perspectives on each. </p><ul><li>Van Ness and Strong are renowned scholars in the field of restorative justice. </li><li>This edition places special emphasis on the importance of inclusion in restorative justice -the opportunity for direct and active involvement of the victim, offender, and community in the procedures that follow a crime. </li><li>A helpful appendix includes a visual case study that helps illustrate the concepts of the text.</li></ul></p><p>Daniel Van Ness is Vice President of Programmes at Prison Fellowship International, an association of national NGOs in more than 125 countries that assist prisoners, ex-prisoners, victims, and their families.

Bravo to Dan Van Ness and Karen Strong for offering a balanced approach to restorative justice that understands "real" justice is about repairing the harm and healing those who have been harmed by crime: victims, offenders, and communities. <i>Restoring Justice </i>is a well-written and quite often inspirational book!"--<b>Ellen Halbert, Director,</b> Victim/Witness Division, Travis County District Attorney's Office, Austin, Texas; Editor, the <i>Crime Victims Report</i>, a national newsletter "At each edition of <i>Restoring Justice</i>, Daniel Van Ness and Karen Heetderks Strong set the standard and make their volume one of the basic books-or perhaps <i>the </i>basic book-on restorative justice. Their book reflects the richness of the restorative justice approach, through process analyses with clinical relevance, theoretical thinking with social ethical and social significance, principled exploration on juridical options, and a broad sociological context analysis. Van Ness and Heetderks Strong colour this broad interdisciplinary picture with their own visions and options. In doing so, they deliver a crucial contribution to understanding restorative justice principles and their proper implementation. <i>Restoring Justice </i>is the result of intensive commitment to the values of restorative justice, balanced with a constructive critical mind for possible problematic implementations, and openness for unanswered questions and unresolved difficulties. It is a landmark in the restorative justice literature."--<b>Lode Walgrave, Professor Emeritus, Catholic University of Leuven </b>"[In <i>Restoring Justice</i>, Dan Van Ness and Karen Strong] challenge researchers and scholars to move beyond measuring only recidivism as the ultimate outcome of evaluation, and victim and offender satisfaction as the primary intermediate measures. Based on this work, we may now instead build upon core principles to develop dimensions and measures of process integrity, as well as theoretical dimensions to assess intermediate outcomes for victim, offender and community."--<b>Gordon Bazemore, Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Florida Atlantic University </b><i>"Restoring Justice </i>is the best, most thorough text on the most important development in the justice system in the last decade: restorative justice. . . . a seminal work. . . this book does a wonderful job of describing the rationale, presenting the arguments, confronting the criticisms. . . provides a measured, reliable statement on our need to restore justice."--<b>Todd Clear, Professor of Criminal Justice, John Jay College of Criminal Justice </b>". . . a great introductory overview of restorative justice . . . easily understood while also providing significant depth. . . . draws together the significant insights in the field while making several new contributions. . .invites and encourages change without alienating people who are currently working in the field.

It describes the development of theories concerning prices and markets, money and the price level, population and capital accumulation, and the choice between socialism and the market economy. The book examines how important economists have reflected on the sometimes conflicting goals of efficient resource use and socially acceptable income distribution. It also provides sketches of the lives and times of the major economists.</p><p><i>Economics Evolving</i> repeatedly shows how apparently simple ideas that are now taken for granted were at one time at the cutting edge of economics research. For example, the demand curve that today's students probably get to know during their first economics lecture was originally drawn by one of the most innovative theorists in the history of the subject. The book demonstrates not only how the study of economics has progressed over the course of its history, but also that it is still a developing science.</p></p><p><p>"Economists have long known Agnar Sandmo as one of our clearest thinkers and most lucid expositors. He uses these skills brilliantly in this history of our discipline. He gives us simple, succinct, and thoughtful accounts of the ideas that have shaped the subject over the past three centuries. This book by itself constitutes a compelling argument for restoring the history of economic thought to the graduate curriculum."<b>--Avinash Dixit, Princeton University</b></p><p>"In this book, one of Europe's greatest contemporary economists writes about great figures in the history of economic thought. Agnar Sandmo's <i>Economics Evolving</i> convinces by its clarity, depth, and readability. Highly recommended for students, scholars, and the general public alike."<b>--Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, Ludwig-Maximilian-University, Munich</b></p><p>"This book shows why the history of economics should be taken more seriously."<b>--Geoffrey M. Hodgson, University of Hertfordshire</b></p><p>"Agnar Sandmo has written a lively, readable, and scholarly account of how the central core of economics has evolved from Adam Smith to the postwar era, and of how it continues to evolve. Students and instructors will find this volume both helpful and enjoyable."<b>--Robert Dimand, Brock University</b></p><p>"This scholarly, authoritative, and lucid survey of the history of economic thought should be required reading for every student of economics, and can be read with profit and pleasure by professional economists and interested noneconomists alike. The book gives just the right amount of detail on the lives and contributions of the great economists, and its most striking achievement lies in its beautifully clear explanations of even the most complex ideas, without recourse to equations or jargon."<b>--Ray Rees, University of Munich</b></p><b>Agnar Sandmo</b> is professor emeritus of economics at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration.

As in the first edition, the pedagogical method is a series of questions and answers, which proceed with the characteristic humor that marked <i>The Little Schemer </i>and <i>The Seasoned Schemer</i>. Familiarity with a functional language or with the first five chapters of <i>T</i><i>he Little Schemer</i> is assumed.&nbsp;</p><p>For this second edition, the authors have greatly simplified the programming language used in the book, as well as the implementation of the language. In addition to revising the text extensively, and simplifying and revising the &#x201c;Laws&#x201d; and &#x201c;Commandments,&#x201d; they have added explicit &#x201c;Translation&#x201d; rules to ease translation of Scheme functions into relations.</p></p><p>Daniel P.

"The Reasoned Schemer, " the latest book in the series, is no exception. Friedman, Byrd, and Kiselyov provide a unique presentation of many of the ideas behind logic programming, which is developed as a natural--though subtle--extension of functional programming. For perfecting your programming skills and style you cannot do better than sit at the feet of Friedman and Kiselyov."--Ehud Lamm, Founder of 'Lambda the Ultimate, ' the programming languages weblog<br><br>"Contrary to popular belief, logic programming doesn't always mean programming in Prolog. In this groundbreaking book, Friedman and Kiselyov extend Scheme to form a completely new kind of logic programming system, one which is in many ways even more elegant than Prolog. Written in the same classic question-and-answer format as the authors' previous book "The Little Schemer, The Reasoned Schemer" covers goals, first-class relations, interleaved and non-interleaved backtracking, the relationship between relational and functional programming, and much more. Reading this book will not only cause your geek rating to skyrocket and impress all the Cool Kids, it will also open your eyes to a paradigm of programming which most programmers are completely unaware of, but which will undoubtedly play a significant role in the programming systems of the future. More importantly, though, this book is great fun to read and will make you a better programmer."--Michael Vanier, Caltech<br><br>"Some programmers are particularly fascinated by new ways of thinking about programming and computation.

And in fact, this one has the broadest horizons yet."--Matt Hellige, Researcher, Accenture Technology Labs</p><h2>The Cardinal Virtues: Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance</h2><p><p>Richard J. Regan's new translation of texts from Thomas Aquinas' <i>Summa Theologica</i> II&#x2013;II--on the virtues prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance--combines accuracy with an accessibility unmatched by previous presentations of these texts. While remaining true to Aquinas' Latin and preserving a question-and-answer format, the translation judiciously omits references and citations unessential to the primary argument. It thereby clears a path through the original especially suitable for beginning students of Aquinas. Regan's Introduction carefully situates Aquinas' analysis of these virtues within the greater ethical system of the <i>Summa Theologica</i>, and each selection is introduced by a thoughtful headnote. A glossary of key terms and a select bibliography are also included.</p></p><p><p>Richard J. Regan is a Research Professor of Political Science, Fordham University.</p><p>Thomas Aquinas is still known in ethics primarily as the quintessential theorist of natural law&#x2015;this despite the fact that his writings on that subject are quite meager in comparison to his exhaustive and masterly treatments of the virtues. The result of Richard Regan's labors is an introduction to Thomas' moral philosophy that is much more indicative of Thomas' rich reflections on the moral life than is available from the study of his natural law writings alone, making accessible Thomas' insights into the cardinal virtues of justice, prudence, courage, and temperance. --Douglas Kries, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Gonzaga University</p><br><br><p>There are perils here for a clumsy editor. Some of the material inviting excision is comparatively ephemeral but some is so integral to the work that its exclusion would leave us with a seriously distorted patchwork with few clues as to the overall world-view of the author. There is also a good deal of material that is contrary to contemporary culture and which timidity would suggest be excised. But Regan's editorial hand is deft. If mortal and venial sin, salvation, the value of consecrated virginity, the immorality of taking interest on a loan are unpalatable to the modern reader, he does not see that as any reason for excluding them. We find startling the prohibition of lying to the enemy in time of war, and the observation that it is permissible to resist an unjust death sentence 'except perhaps, in order to avoid scandal, when resistance might risk a serious public disturbance' (86). This is just one example of the profoundly counter-cultural weighting of the community over the individual in the Natural Law tradition (This is very briefly but effectively flagged by Regan in his Introduction). The extent of the condensation [in Regan's edition] is considerable. . . . Surely he must have left out something of value? I searched for unfortunate omissions. Did he include the distinction between virtue and skill (in terms of intentional failure)? Yes. Does the thesis of the unity of the virtues survive? Yes again. Is the possibility of prudence in sinners included? Yes it is, and the search for omissions begins to seem a waste of time. . . . I would judge the translation to be a fine effort. --Brian Scarlett, <i>The Medieval Review</i></p><br><br><p>Richard J. Regan's translation and introductory explanations are highly readable and very accessible to the average student. There is a wealth of material contained in this small volume. It could serve not only as a useful text in an ethics course, but also as a convenient initiation to Aquinas' thought and method. --Rev. Gerald E. Twaddell, Department of Philosophy, Thomas More College</p></p><h2>The Chinese and the Iron Road: Building the Transcontinental Railroad (Asian America)</h2><p><p>The completion of the transcontinental railroad in May 1869 is usually told as a story of national triumph and a key moment for American Manifest Destiny. The Railroad made it possible to cross the country in a matter of days instead of months, paved the way for new settlers to come out west, and helped speed America's entry onto the world stage as a modern nation that spanned a full continent. It also created vast wealth for its four owners, including the fortune with which Leland Stanford would found Stanford University some two decades later. But while the Transcontinental has often been celebrated in national memory, little attention has been paid to the Chinese workers who made up 90 percent of the workforce on the Western portion of the line. The Railroad could not have been built without Chinese labor, but the lives of Chinese railroad workers themselves have been little understood and largely invisible.</p> <p>This landmark volume explores the experiences of Chinese railroad workers and their place in cultural memory. <i>The Chinese and the Iron Road</i> illuminates more fully than ever before the interconnected economies of China and the US, how immigration across the Pacific changed both nations, the dynamics of the racism the workers encountered, the conditions under which they labored, and their role in shaping both the history of the railroad and the development of the American West.</p></p><p><b>Gordon H. Chang</b> and <b>Shelley Fisher Fishkin</b> are Co-Directors of the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project at Stanford; <b>Hilton Obenzinger</b> is Associate Director and <b>Roland Hsu</b> is Director of Research."Destined to become the go-to resource about Chinese railroad workers in the American West. This anthology assembles an international, interdisciplinary team of leading scholars to conduct the most extensive and thoughtful exploration of these near-mythic, yet heretofore scantly researched, historical subjects producing insights not only into the material conditions of their labor and lives but also the ideological implications of their ubiquity contrasted against their individual illegibility."&#x2013;Madeline Hsu, author of <i>The Good Immigrants: How the Yellow Peril Became the Model Minority</i><br><br>"The long-awaited <i>The Chinese and the Iron Road</i> makes visible the previously invisible Chinese railroad workers who built America's first transcontinental railroad. They are given names, family lives, homes, spiritual beliefs, and agency. The research is astounding. The wide variety of interdisciplinary, international, and collaborative perspectives&#x2015;from archaeology to family history&#x2015;is revelatory and a model for future collaborative projects. This timely and essential volume preserves the humanity of the often-ignored and forgotten immigrant worker, while also uncovering just how important Chinese American railroad workers were in the making of America and its place in the world." (Erika Lee <i>author of <i>The Making of Asian America</i></i>)<br><br>"To understand the emergence of the United States as a major player on the world stage, we must recognize the importance of its two-ocean power, which the transcontinental railroad made possible. Deeply researched and richly detailed, <i>The Chinese and the Iron Road</i> brings to life the Chinese immigrants whose work was essential to the railroad's construction." (Thomas Bender <i>author of <i>A Nation Among Nations: America's Place in World History</i></i>)<br><br>"When I wrote a play in the early 1980s about Chinese workers on the American transcontinental railroad, information was scarce, and often of questionable accuracy. Gordon H. Chang and Shelley Fisher Fishkin's meticulously researched and beautifully written book fills this critical gap in our nation's history. <i>The Chinese and the Iron Road</i> brings to life the stories of workers who defied incredible odds and gave their lives to unite these states into a nation."

Any preacher who does not read widely will find this book compelling enough to provide motivation to read a novel, and short enough to leave plenty of time to do so."<br><br><b>Richard Lischer</b><br> -- author of&nbsp;<i>Stations of the Heart and The End of Words</i><br> "Cornelius Plantinga's&nbsp;<i>Reading for Preaching</i>&nbsp;represents the gift of a lifetime. Plantinga has spent many years mapping great fiction, poetry, biography, and journalism. In this book he shares that map with technologized, digitalized, busy preachers who badly need what he has to offer. This is not a guide to `pretty sermons,' as Niebuhr called them, but to human, deeply textured reflections. . . . I can't imagine a preacher who will not benefit from this gift."<br><br><b>Walter Brueggemann</b><br> -- author of&nbsp;<i>The Prophetic Imagination and Truth Speaks to Power</i><br> "Two matters are unmistakably clear in this book. First, Plantinga loves words, phrases, sentences, and stories. He remembers them, relishes them, and knows their durable power. Second, Plantinga cares about ministers. He knows the burdens and wonders of ministry, and treats preachers with deep respect. . . . Preachers will find in these pages a colleague and fellow traveler who exudes courage and pathos and joy in our common calling."<br><br><b>Thomas G. Long</b><br> -- author of&nbsp;<i>The Witness of Preaching and What Shall We Say?</i><br> "With wit, wisdom, and a fresh supply of his own compelling prose, Cornelius Plantinga invites us into the whitewater adventure of good reading. He speaks directly to preachers, to those who bear the load of weekly sermons and who wonder where they can find language that bristles with energy and faithful imagination. But he also gathers in all Christians who hunger for the old words of the faith - sin, hope, salvation, providence -- to come alive in the vibrant metaphors, rich stories, and telling insights of great literature. This book is about delightful reading, and it is itself a delight to read."<br><br><b>John Ortberg</b><br> -- author of&nbsp;<i>If You Want to Walk on Water, You've Got to Get Out of the Boat</i><br> "Jesus once said we are to love God with all our mind -- I know of no one who does this better than Neal Plantinga. He seems to be incapable of crafting an uninteresting or unedifying sentence. To be able to learn from him how to stock a mind for greater preaching is beyond price. Whatever this book costs, it's not enough."<br><br><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> "Plantinga's sympathetic understanding of the preacher's `daunting task,' combined with his concrete guidance for enhancing homiletic skill, makes this a valuable resource for new and veteran preachers alike."<br><br><b>John Buchanan</b><br> -- editor/publisher of&nbsp;<i>The Christian Century</i><br> "Reading is the necessary backdrop to relevant twenty-first-century preaching. There is no shortcut or substitute. When the gospel and the preacher's personal faith and experience are informed by wide, disciplined, varied, and sustained reading, lively and compelling sermons will be the result. Cornelius Plantinga, an avid and creative reader himself, provides the community of preachers with a very valuable resource and the impetus for all of us to read, read, read."<br><br><b>Lillian Daniel</b><br> -- author of&nbsp;<i>When "Spiritual but Not Religious" Is Not Enough</i><br> "Why don't preachers read more? Preachers are writers who produce more content each week than the average newspaper columnist. Why don't we ravenously read in order to feed the beast of each Sunday's deadline? The truth is that a million pressing callings invade the small space that pastors reserve for reading. And so I give thanks for the deep reading that Cornelius Plantinga has done over the years, and for this gentle guide to words that are worth reading."<br><br><b>Fleming Rutledge</b><br> -- author of&nbsp;<i>And God Spoke to Abraham: Preaching from the Old Testament</i><br> "This treasure of a book by Neal Plantinga offers substantial help to a generation of young preachers (and older ones too) who have not fully grasped the importance of furnishing the mind with great literary writing. . . . Plantinga is discerning, witty, humane, up-to-date, and profoundly pastoral. I urgently recommend this ear-opening book to a host of readers -- including not only preachers but also those who listen to preaching, for they will be enlarged by it as well."<br><br><b>Kevin J. Vanhoozer</b><br> -- editor of&nbsp;<i>Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible</i><br> "This beautifully written gem of a book admirably fulfills its sign function by pointing not at itself but at the thing it is about -- other people's books. Plantinga makes as good a case as I have come across for the importance of reading many books to enrich the preaching of the Christian's one book. Here is no recipe for pretty preaching, which only distracts from the biblical message, but rather a discerning call to `Take, read' and more effectively minister God's word."<br><br><b><i>Christian Century</i></b><br> "Concise, thoughtful, provocative and engaging, this is a book we preachers should read."<br><br><b><i>Preaching</i>&nbsp;(Survey of the Year's Best Books for Preachers)</b><br> "Preachers will find tremendous wisdom and insight from reading Plantinga's short but very potent treatise on the preacher and reading."<br><br><b><i>Christianity Today</i></b><br> "A marvel of concision, blunt good sense, sharp insight, and intellectual generosity. Buy one yourself and one for your pastor."<br><br><b><i>Sharing the Practice</i></b><br> "Plantinga's selections are rich in humor, satire, delight and carry the reader into some powerful times, places and events. This book would be a good resource for ministers to use in discussion groups or in personal study. For the preacher looking to escape the `dry days' and dull preaching, this book offers a<br> challenge to revitalize one's preaching."<br><br><b><i>Theology Today</i></b><br> "Invites preachers into the wonderful world of literature as a primary source for homiletical imagination. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This book offers a concise argument for the necessity of preachers to engage in conversation with great writers. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The permission to read, to schedule reading in one's weekly tasks, and to take reading seriously, will be another great joy of this book."<br><br><b><i>Presbyterian Outlook</i></b><br> "In this book are found riches from novels, short stories, poems and essays that will enrich any preacher's art. That is one of the many delights of this book. One is treated to insightful commentary on a delightfully wide range of reading that demonstrates how the great skill of the authors can be learned by preachers who are seeking to announce the presence of God and move the human heart. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After all these years, I have again found a source for deepening my own reading that may in turn deepen my preaching."<br><br><b><i>Journal of the Evangelical Homiletics Society</i></b><br> "This slim volume, like the book of Proverbs, packs a lot of wisdom &#x2014; insight for skillful living in the fear of God &#x2014; into a few pages. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Plantinga's own prose delights the reader as much as the dozens of passages he quotes from luminaries like Tolstoy and Steinbeck."<br><br><b><i>Mid-America Journal of Theology</i></b><br> "Here is a book that addresses the preacher from a totally different angle. Plantinga makes his case for better preaching, not through the improvement of the mere mechanics of the art of preaching but through a challenge to the preacher to expand his horizons through reading widely beyond theology. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I would recommend this book merely on the strength of his writing and the pleasure it provides. But I also appreciate the author's wisdom and the unpretentious way he goes about commending his program."<br><br><b><i>Congregational Libraries Today</i></b><br> "Plantinga's knowledge is impressive, and combined with practical guidance and humor, provides a text that is a pleasure to read. While preachers are the intended audience, other church leaders, teachers and seminary students will find value."<br><br><b><i>Interpretation</i></b><br> "This short and engaging volume should earn a place on the syllabus of every seminary homiletics course and in every pastor's library. . . . This small, sage book will not ensure wise preaching from its readers, but it will shine some light on the path toward such a goal."<br><br><b><i>Anglican Theological Review</i></b><br> "Every preacher - lay and ordained - should read this book if for no other reason than to develop a reading list. . . . Plantinga masterfully demonstrates throughout the book how to use various types of prose and poetry in sermon writing. . . . Plantinga's writing is engaging, lively, and even humorous - all qualities most preachers pray will be characteristic of their sermons."</p><h2>Hello World</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Lovecraft begins, we find Lovecraft dwelling in misery in a one-room apartment in Brooklyn Heights: his wife, Sonia, has had to move to the Midwest for work, and he must rely on the companionship of the Kalem Club, the informal band of friends in the New York area. In 1926, in part through the intervention of his close friend Frank Belknap Long, Lovecraft finally decided to return to his native Providence, Rhode Island, effectively ending his marriage. That return spurred the greatest spurt of literary creativity he would ever experience: in less than a year, such works as "The Call of Cthulhu," <i>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</i>, <i>The Case of Charles Dexter Ward</i>, and "The Colour out of Space" would emerge from his pen, establishing Lovecraft as the leading weird fictionist of his generation. In spite of his increasing poverty, antiquarian travel occupied much of Lovecraft's time, and he gained an impressive knowledge of such oases of antiquity as Charleston, Quebec, St. Augustine, and Richmond. These voyages both renewed his connection with the past and infused his literary work, as such later tales as "The Whisperer in Darkness" and "The Shadow over Innsmouth" drew ever more profoundly upon his far-flung travels. Intellectually, Lovecraft evolved as well. Recent developments in science confirmed his materialism and his atheism, and the onset of the Great Depression gradually caused him to reassess his political and economic theory; he emerged as a moderate socialist and advocate of the New Deal. Late in life he became a giant in the world of fantasy fandom--a development that foreshadowed his worldwide fame in the decades following his early death.</p><p></p><h2>The Origins of the American Constitution: A Documentary History</h2><p>The complete story of the American Constitution, told in the words of those who created it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning historian Michael Kammen has gathered together the fundamental documents needed to understand the genesis and evolution of the United States Constitution&#x2014;from the exploratory notions concerning the nature of constitutions in 1776, the Articles of Confederation in 1777, and various constitutional plans proposed at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, to the advocacy position of &#x201c;Publius&#x201d; in the 21 most important&nbsp;<i>Federalist&nbsp;</i>papers and contrasting views offered by leading Anti-Federalist dissenters.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kammen also includes private correspondence that passed between prominent founders during the crucial years 1787 to 1789 (58 revealing letters), along with the Judiciary Act of 1789 and the Bill of Rights, which completed the basic structure of government and provided essential security for its citizens.<br> &nbsp;<br> Taken together, these are the great state papers that illuminate America&#x2019;s brilliant and unique contribution to the history of political thought and democratic values.</p><p><b>MICHAEL KAMMEN</b>, the Newton C.

As a baby, he had a serious disease that caused him respiratory issues. He's fine now, but his mom and overprotective brother still think of him as damaged, and his schoolmates see him as the same class clown he's always been. He feels stuck.

She lives in Austin, Texas, and is active within the vibrant Texas writing community.Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;A companion piece to Holt's well-received House Arrest, this compelling novel-in-verse reintroduces readers to the same characters some 11 years later. Levi, who was a sickly infant with a life-endangering condition, is now a cocky, energetic tween with a story of his own to tell: "Who am I?/I am Levi./I am small/but fast/I am smart/but dumb./If you move the letters/of my name around/you get live." He is chafing at the overprotectiveness of Timothy, his big brother, who grew up playing a role beyond his years as Levi's caretaker, and his mother, who once struggled to keep him alive while trying to make ends meet. Levi is tired of being wrapped in cotton wool. He wants to run, play, climb trees, and assert his independence. And he wants, more than anything, to box: "When I hit the bag/BAM BAM BAM/it stopped all my thoughts/and I'm just...in the moment.../arms/fists/feet/moving/moving/an animal/not a boy/a beast/a different/me." How these three characters bob and weave and ultimately grow together into a greater understanding makes for an accessible story that will not only resonate with middle graders who are living under the shadow of a life-threatening illness, but for all tweens who are eager to establish their independence. Levi isn't always likable as he pushes to assert himself but he is always relatable. Well-placed concrete verse adds visual interest and further adds to the kid appeal. VERDICT This character-driven narrative should be an easy sell, especially where House Arrest was popular; fans of thoughtful sports novels-in-verse (e.g. Kwame Alexander's The Crossover) will likely enjoy this as well.&#x2014;Eileen Makoff, P.S. 90 Edna Cohen School, NY</p><h2>It&#39;s a Mitzvah</h2><p>A guide to Jewish living, this book is being called &#34;the Jewish Catalog of the 1990s.&#34; From lighting Shabbat candles to spending a night in a homeless shelter, this book identifies hundreds of ways to transform daily living into Jewish living.</p><p>A guide to Jewish living, this book is the starting point for everyone who wants to increase his or her level of Jewish commitment, but doesn&#39;t know where or how to begin.

He and Gran'ma Ben and Thorn have a terrifying encounter with Kingdok, ruler of the rat creatures. The Hooded One is inciting his army to full-scale war. Someone is continuing to haunt Thorn in her dreams. And then wise Gran'ma Ben disappears. <br><br>To make matters worse, Phoney Bone has hoodwinked the townspeople into believing that he is a mighty dragonslayer. When he actually does catch the Red Dragon -- much to his surprise -- he must face up to his promise: to slay the dragon at sunrise.</p><p>When Bone first came on the scene, critics raved about it, often mentioning it as being "fun for the whole family." Jeff Smith has always been wary about others labeling his work "for children," partly because he knew that "no topic of human experience--from the introspection of <i>Peanuts</i> or the politics of <i>Doonesbury</i> to the lyricism of <i>Pogo</i>--was beyond the wonderful world of comics." He was also cautious because he knew that the story he was telling was going to deal with issues and themes graver than Saturday morning's cotton-candy cartoons. In <i>Bone: The Dragonslayer</i>, the first volume of the second Bone trilogy, there is conflict, sometimes involving violence. There are forces of evil. There is war. But Bone is neither pap nor pabulum; it is challenging without being obtuse, and yes, even within its fantasy setting, Bone is real. This distinct combination makes it the best kind of children's book. Parents, read this book <i>with</i> your children. You'll find it may turn out to be your favorite book, too.Jeff Smith is the creator of the award-winning, NEW YORK TIMES bestselling BONE series.

Greenlaw decided to move back home, to a tiny island seven miles off the Maine coast. There, she would pursue a simpler life as a lobsterman, find a husband, and settle down.<br><br> But all doesn't go as planned. The lobsters refuse to crawl out from under their rocks and into the traps she and her father have painstakingly set. Fellow islanders draw her into bizarre intrigues, and the eligible bachelors prove even more elusive than the lobsters. But just when she thinks things can't get worse, something happens that forces her to reevaluate everything she thought she knew about life, luck, and lobsters.<br><br> Filled with nautical detail and the dramas of small-town life, <em>The Lobster Chronicles</em> is a celebration of family and community. Greenlaw proves once again that fishermen are the best storytellers around.</p><p><strong>Linda Greenlaw</strong> has been a deep-sea fisherman for 18 years, becoming the first and only female swordfish captain in the Grand Banks Fleet. This career earned her a prominent role in Sebastian Junger's runaway bestseller, <em>The Perfect Storm</em> and a protrayal in the subsequent film. She was raised in Maine and graduated from Colby College. Greenlaw now lives on Isle au Haut, Maine, where she captains a lobster boat.In this follow-up to the author's bestseller, THE HUNGRY OCEAN, about her life as a swordfishing boat captain, Greenlaw has returned to her native Isle au Haut, Maine, to live with her parents, fish for lobster with her father as sternman, and hope for a chance to marry and start a family. Since the population of the island is 47 total, she is aware that the plan may have its flaws, but she gives us the year as it comes, making it vivid, salty, and real, a pleasure to read about if not to live through. Like many untrained readers, Greenlaw often rushes her words, but the account is so personal it's still a plus to have it in her own voice.

Mama Duckling swims to shore one day, followed by her five offspring: Pippin, Bippin, Tippin, Dippin, and Little Joe. (Guess who&#x2019;s the one who lags behind to watch a butterfly or check out a big red berry.) The homey village seems like a fine place for a walk&#x2013;but for diminutive ducklings, there are unforeseen hazards. Luckily, there are also watchful, resourceful villagers to rescue the little creatures when they all fall through a storm drain in the street. The language is melodic: &#x201c;The Duck family lived in a pretty pond in a green, green park, in a sunlit little town at the end of a long, long island.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s dramatic: &#x201c;Mama Duck came running after him. &#x2018;Whack! Whack! Whack!&#x2019; she cried. &#x2018;Bring my babies back!&#x2019;&#x201d; It&#x2019;s comically suspenseful: &#x201c;Oh, dear! That could have been the end of the story. But it wasn&#x2019;t, because....&#x201d; Carpenter, a gifted and powerfully versatile illustrator, fills the book with beauty, humor, and a delicious variety of perspectives. Her style here has a sweet old-fashioned spirit&#x2013;a touch of Robert McCloskey, but more visually arresting.

A witness calls the fire department, and Fireman Paul heads down into the drain and rescues each duckling. Fireman Joe is about to carry the babies off in a bucket, but Mama Duck makes such a fuss that Fireman Dennis stops traffic in order to allow Mama Duck to lead her ducklings across the road herself, and a happy ending finds Mama and babies safely back in their own pond in the park. Based on a real event that happened in Montauk, New York in 2000, Moore&#x2019;s story is simply but dramatically told, and repetition of a few key phrases (&#x201c;That could have been the end of the story. But it wasn&#x2019;t, because . . .&#x201d;) will help young listeners focus on the pivotal plot points. The satisfying storyline of a mother and babies separated and reunited is one to which many young children will easily relate, and the ducks themselves have enormous visual appeal. Carpenter&#x2019;s illustrations, rendered in charcoal and digital media with a warm, earth-toned palette, are large and impressive in their artistry; the masterful compositions feature creative perspectives, peering up through the grate with the ducklings or looking down on their doomed trip across the grate. This makes a natural partner for Tafuri&#x2019;s Have You Seen My Duckling? as well as a fine lead-in to the lengthier text of McCloskey&#x2019;s classic Make Way for Ducklings.&nbsp; JH - <i>Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, </i>starred review</p><p></p></p><h2>Wind River Protector</h2><p><b>The new novel from the bestselling author of <i>Home to Wind River</i>.</b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b><i>Real love is worth every risk . . .</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> Ex-Air Force pilot Andy Whitcomb loves nothing more than the wide blue skies, but when a helicopter crash fighting forest fires in California leaves her injured and shaken, she&#x2019;s ready to return home to the peace of Wind River Ranch.

Set in and around Palo Alto, amid the culture clash of new money and old (antiestablishment) values, and with the specter of our current wars looming across its pages, <i>The Portable Veblen</i> is an unforgettable look at the way we live now. A young couple on the brink of marriage&#x2014;the charming Veblen and her fianc� Paul, a brilliant neurologist&#x2014;find their engagement in danger of collapse.

And in one lived a woman in the slim green spring of her life, and her name was Veblen Amundsen-Hovda.</p><p>It was a rainy day in winter, shortly after the New Year. At the end of the street a squirrel raked leaves on the banks of the San Francisquito Creek, looking for pale, aged oak nuts, from which the tannins had been leeched by rain and dew. In muddy rain boots, a boy and a girl ran in circles, collecting acorns, throwing them, screaming with delight in the rain. Children did this every day, Veblen knew, scream in delight.</p><p>The skin of the old year was crackling, coming apart, the sewers sweeping it away beneath the roads. Soon would come a change in the light, the brief, benign winter of northern California tilting to warmth and flowers. All signs that were usually cause for relief, yet Veblen felt troubled, as if rushing toward a disaster. But was it of a personal nature, or worldwide? She wanted to stop time.</p><p>The waterway roared, as frothy as a cauldron, a heaving jam of the year&#x2019;s broken brambles and debris. She watched the wind jerk the trees, quivering, scattering their litter. The creek roared, you see. Did water fret about madness? Did trees?</p><p>With her walked a thirty-four-year-old man named Paul Vreeland, tall and solid of build, branded head to toe in a forge-gray Patagonia jacket, indigo cords from J. Crew, and brown leather Vans that were showing flecks of mud. Under her raincoat, Veblen wore items of indeterminate make, possibly hand-cobbled, with black rubber boots. She was plain and mild in appearance, with hair the color of redwood bark, and eyes speckled like September leaves.</p><p>They stopped at a mossy escarpment in a ring of eucalyptus, redwood, and oak, and a squirrel crept forward to spy.</p><p>&#x201c;Veb,&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been insanely happy lately,&#x201d; he said, looking down.</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; She loved the idea of spending time with someone that happy, particularly if insanely. &#x201c;Me too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tacos Tambien tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I knew you&#x2019;d say sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I always say sure to Tacos Tambien.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; he said, squeezing her hands. &#x201c;To be in the habit of saying <i>sure</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>She drew closer, sensing his touching nervousness.</p><p>&#x201c;You know that thing you do, when you run out of a room after you&#x2019;ve turned off the light?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very cute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; To be cute when one hasn&#x2019;t tried is nice.</p><p>&#x201c;Remember when you showed me the shadow of the hummingbird on the curtain?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I loved that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, it was right in the middle, like it was framing itself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you know that thing you do, when telemarketers call and you sort of retch like you&#x2019;re being strangled and hang up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You like <i>that</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I love it.&#x201d; He cleared his throat, looked down at the ground, not so much at the earth but at his footing on it. &#x201c;I am very much in love with you. Will you marry me?&#x201d;</p><p>A velveteen shell came up from his pocket, opening with a crack like a walnut. In it gleamed a diamond so large it would be a pill to avoid for those who easily gag.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Paul. Look, a squirrel&#x2019;s watching.&#x201d;</p><p>But Paul wouldn&#x2019;t even turn, as if being watched by a squirrel meant nothing to him.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my gosh,&#x201d; she said, examining the alien stone, for which she&#x2019;d never yearned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so big. Won&#x2019;t I smash it into things, won&#x2019;t I wreck it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Diamonds can&#x2019;t be smashed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wreck it?&#x201d; she asked, incredulously.</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t wreck anything. You only make things great.&#x201d;</p><p>Her body quickened, like a tree in the wind. Later, she would remember a filament that passed through her, of being glad she had provided him happiness, but not really sure how she felt herself.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>The squirrel emitted a screech.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that a yes?&#x201d; Paul asked.</p><p>She managed to say it. Yes. Two human forms became as one, as they advanced to the sidewalk, the route to the cottage on Tasso Street.</p><p>Behind them, the squirrel made a few sharp sounds, as if to say he had significant doubts. As if to say, and she couldn&#x2019;t help translating it this way: <i>There is a terrible alchemy coming</i>.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>SUCH WAS THE engagement of Veblen Amundsen-Hovda, independent behaviorist, experienced cheerer-upper, and freelance self, who was having a delayed love affair with the world due to an isolated childhood and various interferences since. At thirty she still favored baggy oversized boy&#x2019;s clothes, a habit as hard to grow out of as imaginary friends.</p><p>That night in her cottage the squirrel paced the attic floor. Rain pelted the rooftop and a low-pressure system whipped the tall trees the town was named for. When his acorn lost its flavor, the squirrel hurled it in a fit of pique, and Paul banged on the wall from below.</p><p><i>You want a piece of me</i>? <i>Only bottled-up jerks bang on walls from below.</i></p><p>The squirrel had his resources. All he had to say was <i>End the attachment</i> and the leaves would fall. It was an important job in autumn to visit all the ones he&#x2019;d planted and stare down their boughs. <i>End the attachment</i>. The trees went bare. The days grew short and cold.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>THAT NIGHT IN BED, she fell upon Paul with odd ferocity, as if to transform or disguise the strange mood that had seized her. It worked. Later, holding her close, Paul whispered, &#x201c;You know what I&#x2019;ll remember forever?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t say &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll think about it&#x2019; when I asked you. You just said <i>yes</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>She felt the joy of doing something right.</p><p>Overhead came a Virginia reel of scrapes and thumps, embarrassing at this juncture, as would be a growling intestine under the sheets.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think it&#x2019;s rats?&#x201d; Paul asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping it&#x2019;s squirrels.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This town is infested with squirrels, have you noticed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather say it&#x2019;s <i>rich</i> with squirrels.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The rain&#x2019;s driving them in,&#x201d; Paul said, kissing her.</p><p>&#x201c;Or they&#x2019;re celebrating for us, prancing with joy.&#x201d;</p><p>He butted her gently. &#x201c;My parents are going to be blown away. They&#x2019;ll say I don&#x2019;t deserve you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really? No way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;ll your mother say?&#x201d; Paul wanted to know.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that it happened fast, and that she&#x2019;ll have to meet you, immediately if not sooner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Should we call and tell them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>She had an internal clock set to her mother&#x2019;s hunger for news, but sometimes it felt good to ignore it.</p><p>&#x201c;What about your father?&#x201d; Paul asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm. He&#x2019;ll just say we&#x2019;ll never be the same.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re old enough not to care what our parents think, but somehow we do,&#x201d; Paul admitted, philosophically.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because they allowed us to exist.&#x201d;</p><p>She had once concluded everyone on earth was a servant to the previous generation&#x2014;born from the body&#x2019;s factory for entertainment and use. A life could be spent like an apology&#x2014;to prove you had been worth it.</p><p>Pressed against him, aware of the conspicuous new ring on her hand catching on the sheets, she jolted when he uttered in his day voice: &#x201c;Veb, those noises don&#x2019;t bother you?&#x201d;</p><p> Not wanting to be mistaken for a person who resides obliviously in a pesthole, she explained, &#x201c;I have this strange thing. If someone around me is bothered by something, I feel like I&#x2019;m not allowed to be bothered.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not <i>allowed</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m under pressure from some higher source to remain calm or neutral, to prevent something terrible from happening.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s kinda twisted. Do you spend a lot of time doing that?&#x201d;</p><p>She reflected that leveraging herself had become a major pastime. Was it fear of the domino, snowball, or butterfly effect? Or maybe just a vague awareness of behavioral cusps, cascading failures, chain reactions, and quantum chaos?</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s instinctive, so I don&#x2019;t even notice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;ll never be able to share a grievance?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh! I&#x2019;ll work on it, if sharing grievances means a lot to you.&#x201d;</p><p>He sniffed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s unreasonable to dislike the sound of gnawing rodents near our bed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; She laughed, and kissed his head.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>IN THE NIGHT she reflected that the squirrel was not <i>gnawing</i>&#x2014;in fact, maybe it was orchestrating a master plan.</p><p>And Paul, she would discover, had many reasons to object to any kind of wild rumpus heard through walls, but had yet to understand the connection.</p><p>And she herself could withstand more than her share of trespasses by willful beings.</p><p>These embedded differences were enough to wreck everything, but what eager young couple would ever believe it?</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>IN THE MORNING, moments after Paul went out to buy pastries, a fluffy <i>Sciurus griseus</i> appeared on her bedroom sill. Its topcoat was charcoal, its chest as white as an oxford shirt, its tail as rakish as the feather in a conquistador&#x2019;s cap. The western gray sat with quiet dignity, head high, shoulders back, casting a forthright glance through the window with its large brown eyes. What a vision!</p><p>She sat up in bed and it seemed quite natural to speak to the animal through the windowpane, though it had been a long while since she had known any squirrels. &#x201c;Well, then! You&#x2019;re a very handsome squirrel. Very dignified.&#x201d; To her amusement, the squirrel lowered its head slightly, as if it understood her and appreciated the compliment. &#x201c;Are you living upstairs? You&#x2019;re a noisy neighbor, and you kept Paul up all night long!&#x201d; This time, the squirrel picked up its head and seemed to shrug. A coincidence, surely, but Veblen hiccuped with surprise. And then the squirrel reached out and placed one of its hands onto the glass, as if to touch the side of her face.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh! You&#x2019;re really telling me something!&#x201d; She extended her hand, but the new ring seemed to interfere, flashing and cold on her finger. She pulled it off and set it on the nightstand. With her hand unadorned, she felt free to place the tips of her fingers on the glass where the squirrel&#x2019;s hand was pressed. The squirrel studied her with warm brown eyes, as if to ask: <i>How well do you know yourself, and all the choices you could make?</i> As if to tell her, <i>I was cut loose from a hellish marriage, and I want to meet muckrakers, carousers, the sweet-toothed, and the lion-hearted, and you don&#x2019;t know it yet, but you are all of these.</i></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2014;what?&#x201d; Veblen said, mesmerized.</p><p>Then, with a flick of its tail, it dashed away.</p><p>She jumped out of bed and threw on her robe and hurried out the back to see where it went, spying nothing but the soft winter grass and the growing wands of the lilies, the wet brown bed of needles beneath the Aleppo pine, the weathered fence line filigreed by termites, the mossy stones by the garage, the lichened roof. She was proud of her humble cottage on Tasso Street.</p><p>Then she went back inside and grabbed her phone to spring the news on her mother. Nothing being fully real until such springing. And nothing with her mother ever simple and straightforward either, and that was the thrill of it. A perverse infantile thrill necessary to life.</p><p>Linus, her stepfather, answered. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, hi, Linus, morning! Can I talk to Mom?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s asleep, dear. I&#x2019;d say try in another few hours.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just wake her up!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, she had a hard night. Had a reaction to the dye on a new set of towels we brought home. She&#x2019;s been flat out since yesterday afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s sad. But I need to talk to her,&#x201d; Veblen said, grinding some coffee.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid to go in there, you know how she gets. I&#x2019;ll open the door a crack and whisper.&#x201d;</p><p>Veblen heard the phone moving through space, then her mother&#x2019;s cramped voice issuing from her big, despotic head obviously at an angle on a bolster. She was never at her best in the morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Veblen, is something wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, not at all.&#x201d;</p><p>Out the window, young moths flitted from the tips of the juniper. A large black beetle gnawed the side of the organ pipe cactus, carving a dwelling of just the right size in the winter shade.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; asked her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;A squirrel just came to the window and looked in at me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why is that so exciting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It held out its paw. It made direct contact with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you were over that. Dear god. Do Linus and I need to come down and intervene?&#x201d;</p><p>Melanie C. Duffy, Veblen&#x2019;s mother, was avid at intervening, and had intervened with resolve in Veblen&#x2019;s life at all points, and was especially prone to anxiety about Veblen&#x2019;s physical and mental health and apt to intervene over that on a daily basis.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, forget it. Maybe it was trying to see my ring.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What ring? I&#x2019;m trembling.&#x201d;</p><p>Veblen blurted: &#x201c;Paul asked me to marry him.&#x201d;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why did you tell me about the squirrel first?&#x201d;</p><p>She found herself in earnest search of an answer, before snapping out of her childhood habit of full accountability.</p><p>&#x201c;Because you like to know <i>everything</i>.&#x201d; She pulled her favorite mugs from the cupboard, wondering when Paul would get back.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very odd you told me about the squirrel first. I haven&#x2019;t even met this man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m calling. When can we come up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said at Christmas it was nothing special.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t. I just didn&#x2019;t want to talk about it yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you have any sense of wanting my input?&#x201d; And such an ironic question it was, for there had already been so much input, so much.</p><p> &#x201c;Of course. That&#x2019;s the point.&#x201d; She held the phone tenderly, as if it were an actual part of her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;I feel excluded from the most important decision of your life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Mom, I&#x2019;m calling you first thing because you&#x2019;re the most important person to me.&#x201d;</p><p>There followed a silence, for her mother tended to freeze up and ignore compliments and love, and court instead all the miffs and tiffs she could gather round, in a perpetual powwow of pity.</p><p>&#x201c;Well. Did you say yes for all the right reasons?&#x201d;</p><p>The coffeemaker gurgled and hissed, a tired old friend doing its best. &#x201c;I think so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Marriage is <i>not</i> the point of a woman&#x2019;s life. Do you understand that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you love him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do, actually.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is everything between you, good, sexually?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, please! Boundaries or whatever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say <i>boundaries</i> like every teenage twerp on TV.&#x201d;</p><p>It bothered Veblen&#x2019;s mother that most people were lazy and had given up original thought a long time ago, stealing stale phrases from the media like magpies. Fair enough. The problem was that her mother always overstated her points, ruining her credibility. Veblen had learned to seek out supporting evidence to give her mother&#x2019;s unique worldview some muscle, and in this case she&#x2019;d found it in the writings of the wonderful William James: &#x201c;We must make search rather for the original experiences which were the pattern-setters to all this mass of suggested feeling...</p></p><h2>The Art of the Photograph: Essential Habits for Stronger Compositions</h2><p><b>Learn to take better pictures in this step-by-step, <b>how-to</b>&nbsp;photography guide filled with tips on lighting, equipment, inspiration, and more.</b><br><br>Featuring more than 200 of master photographer Art Wolfe's stunning images,&nbsp;<i>The Art of the Photograph&nbsp;</i>helps amateur photographers of all levels break bad habits and shatter common yet incorrect assumptions that hold many photographers back.

His UCLA teams won with great centers and with small lineups, with superstars and with team effort, always with quickness, always with class. Wooden was a teacher first and foremost, and his lessons -- taught on the basketball court, but applicable throughout one's life -- are summarized in his famed Pyramid of Success.<br> <br>Andrew Hill was one of the lucky young men who got to learn from Wooden in his favored classroom -- though that is hardly how Hill would have described it at the time. An all-city high school player in Los Angeles, Hill played -- a little -- on three national champions, from 1970 to 1972. Hill was left embittered by his experience at UCLA; he was upset at how unequally Wooden treated his starting players and his substitutes.<br> <br>Hill went on to a successful career in television, rising to the presidency of CBS Productions, where he was responsible for the success of such popular series as <i>Touched by an Angel</i> and <i>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.</i> Hill's job required him to manage many creative people, with the egos and insecurities that usually go along with such talents. And one day, some twenty-five years after he graduated, he was hit with the realization that everything he knew about getting the best out of people he had learned directly from Coach John Wooden.<br> With no small trepidation, Hill picked up the phone to call and thank his old coach and unexpected mentor. To his surprise, Wooden greeted him warmly and enthusiastically. A strong friendship, sealed in frequent visits and conversations, ensued, and endures.<br> <br><i>Be Quick -- But Don't Hurry!</i> tells the story of that friendship. But it also shares the lessons and secrets that Hill learned from Coach Wooden, which hold the key to managing creatively in the idea-driven economy of the twenty-first century. Among those lessons are:<br> <br>-The team with the best players almost always wins<br> <br>-Be quick, but don't hurry: there is never enough time to be sure (and if you are sure, you're probably too late), but you must always keep your balance<br> <br>-Failing to prepare is preparing to fail<br> <br>-The team that makes the most mistakes...<i>wins!</i><br> <br>Full of sound advice and warm reminiscence, <i>Be Quick -- But Don't Hurry!</i> is the management book of a lifetime.</p><p>John Wooden was named ESPN's Coach of the Century for the way he led his UCLA basketball team to the top of the sporting world in the 1960s and '70s. Andrew Hill was a rebellious and sparingly used reserve on the squad before becoming a successful television executive. While it's doubtful that either would have predicted it at the time, the lessons imparted on the court by Wooden eventually helped Hill reach the top of his profession. And in <i>Be Quick--but Don't Hurry</i>, named for one of the legendary coach's ubiquitous aphorisms, the now-grateful prot�g� translates that sage advice into 21 "secrets" that may help others realize similar accomplishments. Like the title, the counsel can usually be boiled down into short expressions that are deceptively simple. Examples include "Focus on effort, not winning," "Balance is EVERYTHING," "Failing to prepare is preparing to fail," and "The team with the best players almost always wins." To show their relevance and power, Hill fleshes them out with solid examples from the hardwood as well as the business world. And with the track record Wooden has compiled, who are we not to take them seriously? --<i>Howard Rothman</i><b>Andrew Hill</b> spent five and a half years as President of CBS Productions and was, until recently, President of Programming for the Channel One Network.

The Swami's deep spiritual insight, fervid eloquence, and broad human sympathy, shine forth in these works and offer inspiration to all spiritual seekers.</p><p>Swami Vivekananda, India's first spiritual and cultural ambassador to the West, came to represent the religions of India at the World Parliament of Religions, held at Chicago in connection with the World's Fair (Columbian Exposition) of 1893. His message of the unity of humankind and harmony of religions was embraced by the public and press of the time as representing the essence of the Parliament. The Swami wished to create a bridge between the East and the West by bringing to America the gift of India's ancient spirituality, in exchange for the scientific and industrial outlook of the West. After four years of traveling and teaching in America and Europe, the Swami returned to India, where he is revered as a "Patriot Saint." The government of India has declared his birthday a national holiday. In 1976 on the occasion of the American Bicentennial, Swami Vivekananda was honored by the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery as one who came to America from abroad during the past 200 years and made a significant impact on its spiritual development. <p>Upon his return to India, Swami Vivekananda founded The Ramakrishna Order of India in the name of his teacher, Sri Ramakrishna, who is regarded as the Prophet of Harmony of Religions. The Order is the pre-eminent religious organization of modern India. More than 1000 monks of the Order serve throughout the world. While in the West the work is mainly in the form of conducting worship, teaching, writing and lecturing, in India the Order is widely known for its vast charitable activities -- running hospitals and schools, rural uplift, and extensive relief work in times of emergency. The Swamis of the Order work tirelessly in the spirit of "Service of God in Man," regarding the service of all people as a veritable form of worship. </p><p>The Centers of the Order in America, often referred to by such names as Ramakrishna or Vivekananda Centers, or Vedanta Societies, were first organized by Swami Vivekananda for the propagation of the Swami's teachings. Today there are Centers in many of America's major cities, including New York, Boston, Providence, Chicago, St. Louis, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Berkeley, Sacramento, and Hollywood. Because of their belief in the underlying truth of all religions, the Centers of the Ramakrishna Order are at the forefront of the Interfaith Movement. (Publisher's comments written by Swami Adiswarananda, Spiritual Leader, Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York).</p>&#34;His words are great music, phrases in the style of Beethoven, stirring rhythms like the march of Handel choruses. I cannot touch these sayings of his, scattered as they are through the pages of books at thirty years&#39; distance, without receiving a thrill through my body, like an electric shock. And what shocks, what transports, must have been produced when in burning words they issued from the lips of the hero!&#34; - Romain Rolland on Swami Vivekananda.</p><h2>The Chaco Meridian: One Thousand Years of Political and Religious Power in the Ancient Southwest</h2><p>Revisiting his ground-breaking synthesis of Southwestern prehistory, Lekson expands our understanding of the political and economic integration of the American Southwest to encapsulate over 1000 years and 1000 km, from Ad 500 to the arrival of the conquistadors, and from Chaco Canyon to Aztec Ruins to Paquim� and even Culiac�n in Sinaloa, Mexico.</p><p>Stephen H. Lekson is professor of anthropology and Curator of Archaeology, Museum of Natural History, at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has authored or edited over 10 books on southwestern archaeology including the award-winning Ancient Lands, Ancestral Places (Borderlands Book of the Year 1993), Canyon Spirits (Colorado Book Award Finalist, 2005), and A History of the Ancient Southwest (New Mexico Book Award, Science, 2010; Southwest Books of the Year, Notable Book, 2010). Lekson is also past president of the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center.This second edition is a reissue of Lekson's controversial book first published in 1999, now significantly updated with recent bibliography and discussion. He credits an early period in prehistoric Pueblo development, focusing on the architecturally elaborate Chaco Canyon, to the appearance and history of rulers (which he would call kings) shifting north, then south to northern Mexico. His ambitious and hardly widely accepted ideas have led to a rich dialogue between archaeologists involved with Chaco archaeology that continues to shape the understanding of Pueblo culture. In a discipline that claims to be scientific not historical, the author stresses that Chaco deserves a historical narrative. Given the amount of work that has been done, archaeologists must say more now than &#x2018;it is a mystery.&#x2019; Writing in an engagingly personal style, Lekson admits his role as a gadfly, deprecatingly indicates where he has been wrong, and advocates passionately for his historical interpretation. This makes the volume one for many readers, not simply those in academic programs of archaeology and anthropology, where it is essential. It also belongs in larger libraries, making it available to the general public. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All levels/libraries. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>When The Chaco Meridian first appeared 15 years ago, it set off a spirited debate that triggered new thinking about Southwestern archaeology. . . .This new edition brings fresh insights to the debate over the shape and scope of Chaco Canyon and its successor centers. Challenging conventional wisdom, Lekson forces the archaeological community to seek new ways of looking at the American Southwest. (<i>American Archaeology</i>)<br><br>In this second edition of The Chaco Meridian, Lekson doubles down on his theory by pushing the Chaco Meridian hundreds of miles north and south as well as hundreds of years back in time. . . .Lekson lays out his argument as one would a legal case. His lively prose, goofy puns and accessible language present the Chaco Meridian persuasively. . . .Fully two-thirds of this update to the 1999 classic is new material. Unlike many archaeologists working today, Lekson tackles big questions and isn&#x2019;t afraid to advance a controversial theory. Extensive chapter endnotes expand and riff on the ideas presented. It&#x2019;s refreshingly free of jargon and a delightful read. (<i>The Surveyor: A Quarterly Publication of the Colorado Archaeological Society</i>)<br><br>The Chaco Meridian is a serious scholarly work, but Lekson&#x2019;s clear, jargon-free prose laced with silly puns makes it accessible to casual readers. . . .Archaeologists will argue about The Chaco Meridian and students will study it for years to come. For those who want to break out of the visitor&#x2019;s center and expand their understanding of the ancient Southwest, The Chaco Meridian will be a valuable reference and a delightful read. (<i>Center for Colorado Studies</i>)<br><br>Not only does this edition contain considerable new content but the meridian itself is also expanded both geographically and temporally.... [The book is an example of] his humorous and modest, if not self-deprecating, style of writing that makes what could be a very dry treatise a thoroughly enjoyable read.... I dove into the deep end and came back up short of breath. Not so much because of the complexity of his arguments, for his clear writing style makes his positions easy to understand, but because of the sheer volume of data he provides to support them. Drawing upon a large body of published reports, with extensive endnotes accompanying each chapter, he presents his case in a lawyer-like fashion with a preponderance of evidence leading me to agree with him that there must be something more to this meridian thing than mere chance... So even if you have read the first edition, you will come away from reading this second one with a more complete and expanded argument in support of this concept and its underlying meaning. And if you have not read the first edition, fasten your seat belt because you are in for a wild ride. (<i>Southwestern Lore</i>)<br><br>Steve Lekson rocked the archaeological world in 1999 with a general theory for Chaco Canyon that answered most of the problems that have puzzled its explorers for a century. In this new edition, he presents copious new evidence and insights to bolster that theory. This book is certain to set the parameters of the debate on Chaco Canyon for years to come. (Mark Michel, President of The Archaeological Conservancy)<br><br>This is vintage Steve Lekson: delightfully entertaining while presenting deeply insightful but highly controversial ideas about the ancient past. If you are fascinated with the iconic masonry ruins of Chaco Canyon and the prehistory of the American Southwest, you will love this book. (David R. Abbott, Arizona State University)</p><h2>Adventures in the Afterlife</h2><p>Adventures in the Afterlife is a powerful journey ofspiritual awakening; a bold quest for answers andenlightenment.

She lives in the Midwest.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Cole Steele could hear the screams coming from the room down the hall. He knew those nightmares intimately, because the demons also visited him every time he closed his own eyes. He was a grown man, hard and disciplined and well able to drink his way through the night if necessary, but Jase was just a young teenager. Guilt edged his anger as he made his way through the dark to the boy's room. He should have done something, to spare his half brother the horrendous legacy of his own past.<br><br>In truth, he hadn't been in touch with his father for years. It hadn't occurred to him that his father would remarry a much younger woman and produce another child, but he should have considered the possibility, not just dropped off the face of the earth. Cole shoved open the bedroom door. Jase was already fully awake, his eyes wide with the terror of his memories. Something twisted hard and painfully in Cole's chest.<br><br>"I'm here, Jase," he announced unnecessarily. He wasn't good at soothing the boy. He had been born and bred in roughness and still had a difficult time being gentle. Worse, Jase barely knew him. He was asking the teenager to trust him in spite of his reputation and the rumors of attempted murder flying freely through the town. It was no wonder the boy regarded him with some suspicion.<br><br>"I hate Christmas. Can't we just make it go away?" Jase asked. He threw back the covers and paced across the room, the same edgy tension in his teenage body that Cole had in abundance as a grown man. Jase was tall and gangly, like a young colt, all arms and legs, looking a bit like a scarecrow in flannel pajamas. He had Cole's dark hair, but his eyes must have been his mother's, as they were a deep, rich brown. Right now, his eyes were wide with terror, and he turned away to hide his trembling.<br><br>Cole felt as if he were looking at himself as a youngster, only Jase had poured himself into books and Cole had become a hellion. Cole knew what it was like to hide the bruises and the terror from the rest of the world. He had grown up living in isolation and hiding, and he still lived that way, but he would be damned if this boy would endure the same.<br><br>"Did he shoot your dog for Christmas?" Cole asked bluntly. "That's what he did for me the last time I wanted to celebrate the holiday like my friends. I haven't ever wanted a Christmas since. He also beat the holy hell out of me, but that was insignificant next to the dog."<br><br>Jase faced him slowly. The horror was still all too stark in his eyes. "I had a cat."<br><br>"I'll bet he said you weren't tough enough and that only sissies needed pets and Christmas. He wanted you to toughen up and be a man. Not get attached to anything."<br><br>Jase nodded, swallowing an obvious lump in his throat. "He did a lot of things."<br><br>"You have burn marks? Scars from cuts? He liked to whip me with a coat hanger. And when I didn't cry, he took to using other things."<br><br>"I cried," Jase admitted.<br><br>"I did too, at first. He was a mean son of bitch, Jase. I'm glad he's dead. He can't touch you anymore. I'm not going to lie to you and tell you the nightmares go away because I still have them. We both lived in hell and he had too much money for anyone to want to believe us." Cole rubbed his hands through his thick black hair. "He was sick, Jase. I got out, changed my name thinking he'd never find me, and stayed as far from him as I could possibly get. That's no excuse. I should have kept tabs on him. Maybe I could have gotten you away from him."<br><br>Jase shook his head. "He never would have let me go."<br><br>"You know what they're all saying, don't you? They think I had something to do with his death."<br><br>Jase nodded, his eyes suddenly wary. "I've heard. Why did you come back?"<br><br>"I was named your guardian in his will. It was the first I'd heard of you. I didn't know you existed until five months ago. I knew he must have done the same thing to you and your mother that he did to me and mine. I thought I could protect you, at least until you're old enough to live on your own. I figured I would be a better guardian than anyone else the court might appoint or that our father had named if I didn't accept."<br><br>Dawn was creeping in through the huge plate-glass window. Cole watched the sun come up. It was cold, and the ground outside was covered with several feet of snow, turning the hills into a carpet of sparkling crystals. "You hungry?"<br><br>"Are you cooking?"<br><br>Cole managed a lazy shrug even though he really wanted to smash something. It was always there, that volcano inside him, waiting to erupt. The thought of his father, the time of year, it wasn't all that difficult to bring rage to the surface. "I thought we'd go into town and give them all something more to gossip about."<br><br>Jase met Cole's eyes squarely. "They say you killed the old man and that you're planning to kill me next. Sixty-four million dollars is a lot of money, twice as much as thirty-two."<br><br>"They do say that, don't they?" Cole said. "And don't forget the ranch. It's worth twice that easily, maybe more with the oil and gas deposits. I haven't actually checked into how much yet." His eyes had gone ice-cold, a piercing blue stare that impaled the boy. "What do you say, Jase? Because in the end, you're the only one that counts as far as I'm concerned."<br><br>Jase was silent a long time. "I say I'm glad you came back. But I don't understand why he left us the money and the ranch when he hated us both so much. It doesn't make any sense." He looked around the enormous room, frowning. "I keep expecting him to show up in the middle of the night. I'm afraid to open my eyes because I know he's standing over the bed, just waiting."<br><br>"With that smile." Cole's voice was grim.<br><br>Jase nodded, a small shudder betraying the fact that he wasn't as calm as he tried to seem. "With that smile." He looked at Cole. "What do you do when the nightmares come?" He punched his fist into his pillow. Once. Twice. "I hate this time of year."<br><br>Cole felt a sharp pain in his chest and the familiar churning in his gut. His own hand balled into a fist, but he tamped down the smoldering anger and hung on to control for the boy's sake. "I drink. I'm your guardian, so I have to say that's not allowed for you. At least not until you're a hell of a lot older."<br><br>"Does it work?"<br><br>"No," Cole said grimly. Honestly. "But it gets me through the night. Sometimes I go to the workout room or the barn. I hung a heavy bag in both places, and I beat on them until my hands hurt. Other times I take the wildest horse we have and go out into the mountains. I run the hills, using the deer trails, anything to make me so tired I can't think anymore."<br><br>"None of that works either, does it?" Jase had tried physical activity as well, but he was finding that talking quietly with his half brother was helpful. More helpful than anything else he'd tried. At least one person believed him. And one person had gone through the same torment. It created a bond in spite of the ugly rumors that surrounded his tough, harder-than-nails half brother.<br><br>Cole shook his head. "No, none of it works, but it gets you through the night. One night at a time. He's dead, Jase, and that's all that matters."<br><br>Jase took a deep breath. "Did you kill him?"<br><br>"No, but I wish I had. I used to lie awake at night and plan how I'd do it. That was before Mom died. Then I just wanted to get out." Cole studied the boy's face. "Did you kill him?" He concentrated his gaze on the boy. Every nuance. Every expression, the way he breathed. The flick of his eyes. The trembling of his hands.<br><br>Jase shook his head. "I was too afraid of him." <br><br>Cole let his breath out slowly. He had stayed alive using his ability to read others, and he was fairly certain that Jase was telling the truth. Jase had been in the house when someone had shot Brett Steele right there in his own office. He wanted to believe that the boy wasn't involved in Brett Steele's death. Cole wasn't certain how he would have handled it if Jase had admitted he'd done it, and for a man in Cole's profession, that wasn't a good thing.<br><br>"Cole, did he kill your mother?" For the first time, Jase sounded like a child rather than a fourteen-year-old trying to be a man. He sank down onto the bed, his thin shoulders shaking. "I think he killed my mother. They said she was drinking and drove off the bridge, but she never drank. Never. She was afraid to drink. She wanted to know what was happening all the time. You know what he was like, he'd be nice one minute and come after you the next."<br><br>Brett Steele had been a sadistic man. It was Cole's belief that he had killed for the sheer rush of having the power of life and death over anything, human or animal. He'd enjoyed inflicting pain, and he had tortured his wives and children and every one of his employees. The ranch was huge, a long way from help, and once he had control over those living on his lands, he never relinquished it. Cole knew he'd been lucky to escape.<br><br>"It's possible. I think the old man was capable of paying everyone off from coroners to police officers. He had too much money and power for anyone to cross him. It would be easy enough for a medical examiner to look the other way if there was enough money in bribes. And if that didn't work, there were always threats. We both know the old man didn't make idle threats; he'd carry them out."<br><br>Jase met his brother's stare directly. "He killed your mother, didn't he?"<br><br>"Maybe. Probably." Cole needed a drink. "Let's go into town and get breakfast."<br><br>"Okay." Jase pulled a pair of jeans from the closet. They were neatly hung and immaculately clean, just like everything else in the room. "Who do you think killed him? If it wasn't either of us, someone else had to have done it."<br><br>"He made a lot of enemies. He destroyed businesses and seduced as many of his friends' wives as possible. And if he killed anyone else, as I suspect he must have, someone could have known and retaliated. He liked to hurt people, Jase. It was inevitable that he would die a violent death."<br><br>"Were you surprised he left you the money and guardianship over me?" <br><br>"Yes, at first. But later I thought maybe it made sense. He wanted us to be like him. He had me investigated and found I spent time in jail. I think he believed I was exactly like him. And the only other choice of a guardian he had was your uncle, and you know how much they despised one another."<br><br>Jase sighed. "Uncle Mike is just as crazy as Dad was. All he talks about is sin and redemption. He thinks I need to be exorcised."<br><br>Cole swore, a long string of curses. "That's a load of crap, Jase. There's nothing wrong with you." He needed to move, to ride something hard, it didn't matter what it was. A horse, a motorcycle, a woman, anything at all to take away the knots gathering in his stomach. "Let's get out of here." <br><br>He turned away from the boy, a cold anger lodged in his gut. He detested Christmas, detested everything about it. No matter how much he didn't want the season to start, it always came. He woke up drenched in sweat, vicious laughter ringing in his ears. He could fight the demons most of the year, but not when Christmas songs played on the radio and in every store he entered. Not when every building and street displayed decorations and people continually wished each other "Merry Christmas." He didn't want that for Jase. He had to find a way to give the boy back his life.<br><br>Counseling hadn't helped either of them. When no one believed a word you said, or worse, was bought off, you learned to stop trusting people. If Cole never did another thing right in his life, he was going to be the one person Jase would know he could always trust. And he was going to make certain the boy didn't turn out the way he had. Or the way their father had.<br><br>The brothers walked through the sprawling ranch house. The floors were all gleaming wood, the ceilings open-beamed and high. Brett Steele had demanded the best of everything, and he got it. Cole couldn't fault him on his taste. <br><br>"Cole," Jase asked, "why were you in jail?"<br><br>Cole didn't break stride as he hurried through the spacious house. At times he wanted to burn the thing down. There was no warmth in it, and as hard as he'd tried to turn the showpiece into a home for Jase, it remained cold and barren. <br><br>Outdoors it was biting cold. The frost turned the hills and meadows into a world of sparkling crystal, dazzling the eyes, but Cole simply ignored it, shoving his sunglasses onto his face. He went past the huge garage that housed dozens of cars -- all toys Brett Steele had owned and rarely ever used -- to go to his own pickup.<br><br>"I shouldn't have asked you," Jase muttered, slamming the door with unnecessary force. "I hate questions."<br><br>Cole paused, the key in the ignition. He glanced at the boy's flushed face. "It isn't that, Jase. I don't mind you asking me anything. I made up my mind I'd never lie to you about anything, and I'm not quite certain how to explain the jail time. Give me a minute."<br><br>Jase nodded. "I don't mind that you've been in jail, but it worries me because Uncle Mike says he's going to take you to court and get custody of me. If I lived with him, I'd spend all my life on my knees, praying for my soul. I'd rather run away."<br><br>"He can't get you away from me," Cole promised, his voice grim. There was a hard edge to the set of his mouth. He turned his piercing blue gaze directly on his young half brother. "The one thing I can promise is I'll fight for you until they kill me, Jase." He was implacable, the deadly ruthless stamp of determination clear on his face. "No one is going to take you away from me. You got that?"<br><br>Jase visibly relaxed. He nodded, a short jerky gesture as he tried to keep his emotions under control. Cole wasn't certain if that was good or bad. Maybe the boy needed to cry his eyes out. Cole never had. He would never give his father the satisfaction, even when the bastard had nearly killed him. <br><br>It was a long way to the nearest town. There had been numerous guards at the ranch when his father was alive, supposedly for security, but Cole knew better. Brett had needed his own private world, a realm he could rule with an iron fist. The first thing Cole had done was to fire all of the ranch hands, the security force, and the housekeeper. If he could have had them prosecuted for their participation in Brett's sadistic depravities, he would have. Jase needed to feel safe. And Cole needed to feel as if he could provide the right atmosphere for the boy. They had interviewed the new ranch hands together, and they were still looking for a housekeeper.<br><br>"You, know, Jase, you never picked out one of the horses to use," Cole said.<br><br>Jase leaned forward to fiddle with the radio. The cab was flooded with a country Christmas tune. Jase hastily went through the stations, but all he could find was Christmas music and he finally gave up in exasperation. "I don't care which one I ride," Jase said, and turned his head to stare out the window at the passing scenery. His voice was deliberately careless.<br><br>"You must have a preference," Cole persisted. "I've seen you bring the big bay, Celtic High, a carrot every now and then." The boy had spent a little time each day, brushing the horse and whispering to it, but he never rode the bay.<br><br>Jase's expression closed down instantly, his eyes wary. "I don't care about any of them," he repeated.<br><br>Cole frowned as he slipped a CD into the player. "You know what the old man was all about, don't you, Jase? He didn't want his sons to feel affection or loyalty to anything or anyone. Not our mothers, not friends, and not animals. He killed...</p><h2>A History of Playing Cards and a Bibliography of Cards and Gaming</h2><p>Most likely invented in the Far East, playing cards arrived in Europe at roughly the same time as paper money and gunpowder, and by the early eleventh century were in widespread use in France. This classic history, never superseded, not only tells the story of playing cards and their manufacture, but also provides the reader with a fascinating overview of heraldry, geography, history, and social and political activities over the past six centuries. <br>In addition to making extensive use of the magnificent collection of the United States Playing Card Company in Cincinnati, this volume focuses on playing cards of China, Japan, India, Europe, Russia, and America. Also included is an enormous annotated bibliography of more than 900 items on playing cards and games, and probably the largest range of card illustrations, all royalty-free, ever assembled in one place: 1,462 photographs, of which 16 are in color on the covers.<br></p><p></p><h2>Albert Murray: Collected Essays &amp; Memoirs (LOA #284): The Omni-Americans / South to a Very Old Place / The Hero and the Blues / Stomping the Blues / ... (Library of America Albert Murray Edition)</h2><p>In his 1970 classic <i>The Omni-Americans</i>, Albert Murray&nbsp;(1916&#x2013;2013) took aim at protest writers and social scientists who&nbsp;accentuated the &#x201c;pathology&#x201d; of race in American life. Against&nbsp;narratives of marginalization and victimhood, Murray argued that&nbsp;black art and culture, particularly jazz and blues, stand at the very&nbsp;headwaters of the American mainstream, and that much of what&nbsp;is best in American art embodies the &#x201c;blues-hero tradition&#x201d;&#x2014;&nbsp;a heritage of grace, wit, and inspired improvisation in the face of&nbsp;adversity. Murray went on to refine these ideas in <i>The Blue Devils&nbsp;of Nada</i> and <i>From the Briarpatch File</i>, and all three landmark collections&nbsp;of essays are gathered here for the first time, together&nbsp;with Murray&#x2019;s memoir<i> South to a Very Old Place</i>, his brilliant&nbsp;lecture series <i>The Hero and the Blues</i>, his masterpiece of jazz criticism&nbsp;<i>Stomping the Blues</i>, and eight previously uncollected pieces.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

His writing about racism can prickle your skin. . . . To paraphrase Murray's praise of Ellison's <i>Invisible Man</i>, reading this book is like watching someone take a 12-bar blues song and score it for a full orchestra." <b>&#x2014; Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times<br><br></i></b>"Murray &#x2014; renaissance man, blues philosopher, resolute non-victim &#x2014; was almost criminally overlooked in the previous century. Perhaps this was because he was constitutionally incapable of suffering fools of any complexion and insisted on pointing out the most elemental truths: 'The United States is in actuality not a nation of black people and white people. It is a nation of multicolored people,' Murray notes in his masterpiece,&nbsp;<i>The Omni-Americans</i>.&nbsp;We are in desperate need of such lucidity. If the arc of the intellectual universe also bends towards justice, then the Library of America&#x2019;s canonization will resituate Murray alongside contemporaries James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison."<b><i> &#x2014;New York Magazine </i>"100 Best Books of the Twentieth Century"&nbsp;</b></p><h2>The New World: 1500-1750- Graphic U.S History (Saddleback Graphic: American History)</h2><p>1500-1750; Fast-paced and easy-to-read, these graphic U.S. history titles teach students about key historical events in American history from 1500 to the present.

Rylant, whose talent has many sides, here turns to her inner poet as she asks children to look at a day in new ways: &#x201c;a perfect piece of time to live a life, /&nbsp;to plant a seed.&#x201d; As she takes readers through the day of a farm boy who feeds his chickens and checks his plants, she reminds children&nbsp;that a&nbsp;day can bring hope and kindness: &#x201c;You can make a wish, / and start again.&#x201d; And while a day might bring rain, that very shower could&nbsp;teach you how to dance. She&nbsp;tells children what even adults should always keep in mind: &#x201c;The past is sailing off to sea, / the future&#x2019;s fast asleep. / A day is all you have to be, / it&#x2019;s all you get to keep.&#x201d; Matching Rylant&#x2019;s warm words is McClure&#x2019;s amazing artwork.&nbsp;At first glance, the bold figures in black and white set against&nbsp;pure gold or sky-blue backgrounds seem to be woodcuts, but&nbsp;they are&nbsp;actually&nbsp;a sturdier variant of&nbsp;cut paper. If&nbsp;McClure makes a mistake, she notes, she &#x201c;just has to keep cutting and find a solution.&#x201d; Perhaps there were mistakes along the way, but viewers wouldn&#x2019;t ever know it, and&nbsp;the finished product is a handsome, effective&nbsp;piece of bookmaking that captures the glory of a day and the possibilities it holds.

She enjoys her freedom and longs to engage with such earthly delights as flowers and ocean waves. Lady Wind observes her dreams and carries her off, past the pursuing thunderclouds, the lightning, and the dark mountains. In the morning, they arrive at a place where Little Cloud can see a rainbow, dew falling from her garments, and mist, and she happily declares, "Now I see. I can be me <i>and</i> part of something too." Young readers will empathize with Little Cloud's desire to be independent and free from what is expected of her, and they will feel her happiness at finding a place where she can realize her dreams with the help of a nurturing figure. But the oft-told story is tired, and even Qualls's whimsical depictions of a cherubic little girl with cloud hair and a Thelonius Monk-channeling storm cloud can't freshen it. The message of Aesop's "The Bundle of Sticks," that there is "strength in unity"&#x2014;the fable that Morrison claims inspired this tale&#x2014;is lost on young readers.&#x2014;<i>C. J.

Only my eyes are visible, and I blow bubbles to ensure the rest of me stays submerged until the opportune time. Besides the lifeguard watching from his perch, there&#x2019;s a gaggle of girls my age patrolling the beach with younger siblings in tow. They pace in their flip-flops and bikinis, and I wait.<br> <br>The ideal time is when no one&#x2019;s around and no one&#x2019;s looking. But right now there&#x2019;s a little girl cross-legged on wooden bleachers peering at me from beneath a hand held aloft at her forehead, a smile on her face. I can&#x2019;t tell if the smile is a result of how long she&#x2019;s been watching me bob here in the water.<br> <br>To check whether she&#x2019;s staring, I test her with a long gaze to the left of the bleachers, where Dad and his wife Linda are barbecuing. Their oldest son, Logan, round and berry-brown from a day in the sun, is digging a hole nearby, while the newest addition, Luke, lies on a quilt wearing a swim diaper.<br> <br>Dad said I&#x2019;d love it here because the beachfront cottage they&#x2019;d rented was one of the only two Cherie and Ed had let out this weekend. Secluded. Serene. Safe.<br> <br>Ha. Cherie and Ed forgot to mention that the beach portion doesn&#x2019;t actually belong to them and is public property at all hours of the day. Party central.<br> <br>I look back, and, hallelujah, the girl on the bleachers is gone. There&#x2019;s also a lull on the shore now. The lifeguard&#x2019;s turned to talk to someone behind him, and the beach girls are on the far right, peering at a sand castle.<br> <br>I stand and cringe at the sucking sound as my swimsuit sticks to me, all four yards of the spandex-Lycra blend of it. Waterfalls gush out of the many hems on the outfit, and, as I hobble out of the lake, more secret pockets release their water. I&#x2019;m a drippy, squelchy mess, stumbling toward Dad and Linda, picking up tons of sand as I move. I refuse to look around in case I see someone, everyone, watching me.<br> <br>Maybe my face reveals something, because Dad starts right away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Janna, why do you have to wear that thing? You could have said, No, I&#x2019;m not wearing your burkini, Mom.&#x201d; He waves around long tongs as he speaks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom didn&#x2019;t get it for me. I ordered it online.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw her hand it to you as we were packing the car.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;d left it on the hall table, Dad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s her kind of thing. What&#x2019;s wrong with the way Linda&#x2019;s dressed?&#x201d; He snaps the tongs at Linda. She&#x2019;s wearing a one-piece, just-had-a-baby, flouncy-at-the-hips number, and, really, I&#x2019;d rather be in my burkini. It&#x2019;s black and sleek. Sure, when it gets wet, you kind of resemble a droopy sea lion, but at least it isn&#x2019;t pink and lime green like Linda&#x2019;s swimsuit is.<br> <br>&#x201c;Linda, you look great.&#x201d; I smile at her, and she smooths out her flounces.<br> <br>&#x201c;Too bad you&#x2019;re not her size&#x2014;she could have lent you one of her suits, right, Linda?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad, I won&#x2019;t wear it. I&#x2019;m a hijabi, remember?&#x201d; I take a plate and add a piece of chicken from the platter.<br> <br>&#x201c;At the beach? Even at the beach?&#x201d; Dad&#x2019;s gesticulating again and looking around&#x2014;for what, I don&#x2019;t know. When he spies a woman unfolding a lounge chair nearby and starts talking louder, I realize it&#x2019;s for an audience. He wants an audience while he rants at me.<br> <br>Maybe I should&#x2019;ve listened to Mom and not come. My first vacation with Dad&#x2019;s family since my parents split when I was eleven and it&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m a visitor among the earthlings frolicking on a beach in Florida.<br> <br>Before this, I&#x2019;d only spent the odd weekend here and there with Dad at his house in Chicago. I was &#x201c;Daddy&#x2019;s princess&#x201d; back then.<br> <br>The woman in the chair listens intently as Dad lectures. Linda&#x2019;s got a hand on his arm, and it&#x2019;s traveling up to his shoulder with a firmer grip, but he&#x2019;s still talking.<br> <br>&#x201c;How come you have to hide your God-given body?&#x201d; He turns a few burgers over. He&#x2019;s wearing a white T-shirt and red shorts over his God-given body. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not me who forces her to dress like that, that&#x2019;s for sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman looks at me, then at Dad and opens a book.<br> <br>Linda places a hand on my glistening black back and hands me a can of pop. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you a burger when they&#x2019;re done,&#x201d; she whispers.<br> <br>I move to sit on the bleachers before I realize the beach girls are sauntering this way again. I&#x2019;m a swirl of sand art against a black canvas.<br> <br>I duck under the wooden slats of the seats. Cradling my plate on crossed legs, I flip back the swim cap that&#x2019;s attached to my suit and undo my hair. Sand trickles down with the beads of water. Some of it falls onto my chicken.<br> <br>Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, my favorite author: That&#x2019;s who I need right now.<br> <br>Flannery would take me away from here and deposit me into her fictitious world crawling with self-righteous saints and larger-than-life misfits. And I&#x2019;d feel okay there because Flannery took care of things. Justice got served.<br> <br>I forgot to pack her gigantic book of short stories because everything was last minute. I&#x2019;d wanted to escape so badly that when Dad mentioned this trip with his family, I&#x2019;d asked, &#x201c;Can I come?&#x201d; without thinking.<br> <br>Mom had tried to put her foot down about taking a vacation right before exams, but, luckily for me, my brother Muhammad is home for the summer from college.

And little things can wield great power.<br>In a world of vast kingdoms lives a king who is happy and content to reign over all things small. Not so King Normous. He wants to be Ruler of All the World. After having erased every empire and raided every realm, Normous is enraged to learn that the King of Little Things still rules over his tiny kingdom. He sends his army to defeat this upstart, but he finds he cannot outfight or outwit a king who holds sway over the small things of the world. After all, it is the small things that keep the big things going.<br>Bil Lepp&#x2019;s imaginative tale of the beauty and importance of all things small is perfectly paired with illustrator David T. Wenzel&#x2019;s bright watercolor paintings.</p><p>Bil Lepp is a nationally renowned storyteller who has been featured numerous times at the National Storytelling Festival, at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, and at major events across the country. He is also a recipient of the Storytelling Circle of Excellence Award. He lives in West Virginia.<br><br>David T. Wenzel is an illustrator and children&#x2019;s book artist, best known for illustrating the graphic novel edition of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x2019;s The Hobbit. He lives in Connecticut.&#x201c;Small, Lepp clearly feels, is beautiful. Yet the story doesn&#x2019;t pall. Lepp revels in exploring the many ways the King of Little Things&#x2019; insignificant but loyal subjects serve him... Wenzel delivers Mad magazine-style spreads of medieval feasts, battles, capes, and crowns. Brainy wordplay abounds, and a scavenger hunt is included, too. Lepp affirms living simply without sounding smarmy, and Wenzel offers a king whose underpants fall off. What&#x2019;s not to like?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The tale moves briskly, with high drama and gentle humor, and allows readers to find the moral naturally. Wenzel&#x2019;s watercolor illustrations are in perfect harmony with the text, in both detail and tone. Endpapers depict an assortment of small things that can be found within the illustrations, encouraging further examination. Adults and children who read this delightful and imaginative book together will find lots to talk about.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wenzel&#x2019;s watercolor illustrations present a medieval world of turreted castles, banquet tables laden with food, and raiding soldiers. There are plenty of humorous details such as nails that spring from doors and buttons that pop from suspenders. The witty writing enlivens this fable about appreciating the small things in life.&#x201d;</p><h2>Hope Is Not a Method: What Business Leaders Can Learn from America&#39;s Army</h2><p>Since the end of the Cold War, the United States Army has been reengineered and downsized more thoroughly than any other business. In the early 1990s, General Sullivan, army chief of staff, and Colonel Harper, his key strategic planner, took the post-Cold War army into the Information Age. Faced with a 40 percent reduction in staff and funding, they focused on new peacetime missions, dismantled a cumbersome bureaucracy, reinvented procedures, and set the guidelines for achieving a vast array of new goals.<br><i>Hope Is Not a Method</i> explains how they did it and shows how their experience is extremely relevant to today's businesses.

Her life and work, well documented in her lifetime and since, have taken on mythic proportions. Hawai�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;i is also mythic in our national psyche�&#x20ac;&#x201d;a paradisiacal place of healing and renewal. <br><br>In 1938, the Dole Pineapple Co. invited Georgia O'Keeffe to come to Hawai'i to produce two paintings for their national advertising campaign. Like other great artists of her day, including Kuniyoshi, Sheets, and Noguchi, she accepted, and in the spring of 1939 spent nine weeks the Hawaiian Islands. On Maui, where she was hosted by 12-year-old Patricia Jennings, the daughter of the Hana sugar plantation manager, she had an encounter that would affect both women for the rest of their lives.<br><br>Patricia was an isolated introvert, homeschooled and raised by a highly critical mother. When Georgia O�&#x20ac;&#x2122;Keeffe arrived in Hawai�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;i, she was in the throes of marital duress and health challenges. Georgia and Patricia�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s 10 days together were deeply bonding and profoundly healing. Patricia was nurtured by a mother figure and Georgia recovered emotionally and physically and produced 20 little known yet magnificent works of art. <br><br>In Georgia O'Keeffe's Hawai'i, Patricia Jennings Morriss tells the story of their encounter, offering glimpses and a fresh look at the process of the great artist through the eyes of a pre-war teen in territorial Hawai�&#x20ac;&#x2122;i. O�&#x20ac;&#x2122;Keeffe�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s 20 lush paintings of Island flora and landscapes are reproduced together here for the first time. Reflecting on her time on Maui, O�&#x20ac;&#x2122;Keeffe wrote, �&#x20ac;&#x153;I enjoy this drifting off into space on an island.�&#x20ac; Years later, she added, it was one of �&#x20ac;&#x153;the best things I have done.�&#x20ac; <br><br>In 1940, O�&#x20ac;&#x2122;Keeffe�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Hawai�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;i paintings were exhibited at a An American Place in New York to critical acclaim, yet in the years since, they�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve only been displayed all together once. In the introduction to Georgia O�&#x20ac;&#x2122;Keeffe�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Hawaii, art historian Jennifer Saville asserts that O�&#x20ac;&#x2122;Keeffe�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s nine-week sojourn in the Hawaiian Islands helped shape her career, bridging themes examined earlier to later subjects. This heartwarming, informative read fills a gap in our knowledge about the life and work of one of this great artist.

Why do we put up with the anxiety, the pain, the shame, and the longing never fulfilled?</p> <p>This brilliant book explores the nature of these "marvelous disasters" and finds a deeper necessity in the betrayals, taboos, and excesses of impossible love. Using perhaps the greatest of all tragic romances-the passion between H�loise and Abelard-as a psychological scaffold, Jan Bauer examines the erotic structures of irresistible attraction with love stories from the lives of men and women today.

Here we find not one reliable narrator but two &#x201c;unreliable&#x201d; narrators: the young man who is a student at the &#x201c;school for fools&#x201d; and his double. What begins as a reverie (with frequent interruptions) comes to seem a sort of fairy-tale quest not for gold or marriage but for self-knowledge. The currents of consciousness running through the novel are passionate and profound. Memories of childhood summers at the dacha are contemporaneous with the present, the dead are alive, and the beloved is present in the wind. Here is a tale either of madness or of the life of the imagination in conversation with reason, straining at the limits of language; in the words of Vladimir Nabokov, &#x201c;an enchanting, tragic, and touching book.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Sasha Sokolov</b> was born in Canada in 1943. His father, a high-ranking Soviet diplomat, was deported from Canada as a spy in 1946, and Sokolov grew up in the Soviet Union, where he studied journalism at Moscow State University. He made repeated attempts to escape from the USSR, for which he was briefly imprisoned, but after international protests, he was finally permitted to leave the country in 1975. That same year the manuscript of <i>A School for Fools</i>, his first novel, was smuggled out of the Soviet Union and published in the West to great acclaim. The recipient of the prestigious Andrei Bely Prize in 1981 and of the Pushkin Prize for literature in 1996, Sokolov is the author of the novels <i>Astrophobia</i> and <i>Between Dog and Wolf</i> and of a book of essays, <i>In the House of the Hanged</i>.<br><br><b>Alexander Boguslawski</b> is a professor of Russian studies at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida."A work of genius voiced by a narrator and his double &#x2014; simultaneously. It&#x2019;s a Joycean work that unravels in fits and starts, but always beautifully....[by] one of the great living Russian writers." &#x2014;<i>Flavorwire</i><br><br>&#x201c;Sokolov&#x2019;s <i>A School for Fools</i> should be considered one of the finest 20th-century Russian novels.&#x201d; &#x2014;Harvey Pekar, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;If Joyce had written the last chapter of <i>Ulysses</i> in Russian it would have sounded like this." &#x2014;Vladimir Markov <br><br>&#x201c;Sokolov is one of those rare novelists whose primary concern is the praise and exploration of a language rather than the development of a position. In this, he is in the line of Gogol, Lermontov, Nabokov. &#x2018;For me, the Bible says it: The Word is God,&#x2019; Sokolov says, &#x2018;and God is more important than life.&#x2019; &#x201d; &#x2014;David Remnick, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;An enchanting, tragic, and touching work.&#x201d; &#x2014;Vladimir Nabokov<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;[<i>A School for Fools</i>] will undoubtedly come to be recognized as one of the great classics of Russian prose.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Newsweek</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The voice is amazingly sensitive and imaginative, gloriously lucid of language and full of broad comedy and whimsical wit. For all its gloominess, this strange novel is a celebration of life.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A lyrical vision of extraordinary intensity. Sokolov is an astounding new voice.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Daily News</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A puzzling and wonderful book.

It is deeply moving to think how these poems were made ritually, one a year, slowly accumulating for sixty years. Luci Shaw is one of our most gifted poets; maybe that's why this archaeological dig to her beginnings makes me so happy. It is fascinating to watch her marshal her forces, gather linguistic power, and fill a lifetime to the brim with limpid, startling poems."&nbsp;<b>John Leax</b><br> "Luci Shaw knows that 'what must be announced' cannot easily be said. She knows that incarnation makes 'impossible demands' on the poet. A faithful bearer of the Word, she risks everything. Metaphor after metaphor, image after complicating image, she sustains her dedication to making the old story new. In her poems we find 'that flash of absolute knowing' that cannot be earned but is given by grace to the open and waiting."&nbsp;<b>Julia Kasdorf</b><br> "For good reason Luci Shaw has become an institution of the Christian literary world, and here is her sequence dealing with an explicitly Christian subject ? the life of Jesus Christ, vividly figured over the course of the writer's lifelong imaginative work. These lucid, engaging narrative lyrics of both free and formal verse could serve as devotional reading for the devout or as compelling invitations to the seeker. Carefully crafted yet never pretentious or aloof, they bring the sacred close without denying its inexplicable mystery so that, reading them, we too may seem to be accompanied by angels."</p><h2>Midwestern Native Shrubs and Trees: Gardening Alternatives to Nonnative Species: An Illustrated Guide</h2><p><p>In this companion volume to the bestselling <i>The Midwestern Native Garden: Native Alternatives to Nonnative Flowers and Plants,</i> Charlotte Adelman and Bernard L.

Out of defeat emerged a civil religion that embodied the Lost Cause. As Charles Reagan Wilson writes in his new preface, &#34;The Lost Cause version of the regional civil religion was a powerful expression, and recent scholarship affirms its continuing power in the minds of many white southerners.&#34;</p><p>Charles Reagan Wilson documents, for the first time, that for over half a century there existed not one, but two civil religions in the United States, the second not dedicated to honoring the American nation. Extensively researched in primary sources, Baptized in Blood is a significant and well-written study of the South's civil religion, one of two public faiths in America. In his comparison, Wilson finds the Lost Cause offered defeated Southerners a sense of meaning and purpose and special identity as a precarious but distinct culture. Southerners may have abandoned their dream of a separate political nation after Appomattox, but they preserved their cultural identity by blending Christian rhetoric and symbols with the rhetoric and imagery of Confederate tradition. <p> "Civil religion" has been defined as the religious dimension of a people that enables them to understand a historical experience in transcendent terms. In this light, Wilson explores the role of religion in postbellum southern culture and argues that the profound dislocations of Confederate defeat caused southerners to think in religious terms about the meaning of their unique and tragic experience. The defeat in a war deemed by some as religious in nature threw into question the South's relationship to God; it was interpreted in part as a God-given trial, whereby suffering and pain would lead Southerners to greater virtue and strength and even prepare them for future crusades. From this reflection upon history emerged the civil religion of the Lost Cause. While recent work in southern religious history has focused on the Old South period, Wilson's timely study adds to our developing understanding of the South after the Civil War. </p><p> The Lost Cause movement was an organized effort to preserve the memory of the Confederacy. Historians have examined its political, literary, and social aspects, but Wilson uses the concepts of anthropology, sociology, and historiography to unveil the Lost Cause as an authentic expression of religion. The Lost Cause was celebrated and perpetuated with its own rituals, mythology, and theology; as key celebrants of the religion of the Lost Cause, Southern ministers forged it into a religious movement closely related to their own churches. In examining the role of civil religion in the cult of the military, in the New South ideology, and in the spirit of the Lost Cause colleges, as well as in other aspects, Wilson demonstrates effectively how the religion of the Lost Cause became the institutional embodiment of the South's tragic experience.</p>CHARLES REAGAN WILSON is director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture and a professor of history at the University of Mississippi.

CABINET</b><p>Inchmale hailed a cab for her, the kind that had always been black, when she'd first known this city.</p><p>Pearlescent silver, this one. Glyphed in Prussian blue, advertising something German, banking services or business software; a smoother simulacrum of its black ancestors, its faux-leather upholstery a shade of orthopedic fawn.</p><p>"Their money's heavy," he said, dropping a loose warm mass of pound coins into her hand. "Buys many whores." The coins still retained the body heat of the fruit machine from which he'd deftly wrung them, almost in passing, on their way out of the King's Something.</p><p>"Whose money?"</p><p>"My countrymen's. Freely given."</p><p>"I don't need this." Trying to hand it back.</p><p>"For the cab." Giving the driver the address in Portman Square.</p><p>"Oh Reg," she said, "it wasn't that bad. I had it in money markets, most of it."</p><p>"Bad as anything else. Call him."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Call him," he repeated, wrapped in Japanese herringbone Gore-Tex, multiply flapped and counter-intuitively buckled.</p><p>He closed the cab's door.</p><p>She watched him through the rear window as the cab pulled away. Stout and bearded, he turned now in Greek Street, a few minutes past midnight, to rejoin his stubborn prot�g�, Clammy of the Bollards. Back to the studio, to take up their lucrative creative struggle.</p><p>She sat back, noticing nothing at all until they passed Selfridges, the driver taking a right.</p><p>The club, only a few years old, was on the north side of Portman Square. Getting out, she paid and generously tipped the driver, anxious to be rid of Inchmale's winnings.</p><p>Cabinet, so called; of Curiosities, unspoken. Inchmale had become a member shortly after they, the three surviving members of the Curfew, had licensed the rights to "Hard to Be One" to a Chinese automobile manufacturer. Having already produced one Bollards album in Los Angeles, and with Clammy wanting to record the next in London, Inchmale had argued that joining Cabinet would ultimately prove cheaper than a hotel. And it had, she supposed, but only if you were talking about a very expensive hotel.</p><p>She was staying there now as a paying guest. Given the state of money markets, whatever those were, and the conversations she'd been having with her accountant in New York, she knew that she should be looking for more modestly priced accommodations.</p><p>A peculiarly narrow place, however expensive, Cabinet occupied half the vertical mass of an eighteenth-century townhouse, one whose fa�ade reminded her of the face of someone starting to fall asleep on the subway. It shared a richly but soberly paneled foyer with whatever occupied the other, westernmost, half of the building, and she'd formed a vague conviction that this must be a foundation of some kind, perhaps philanthropic in nature, or dedicated to the advancement of peace in the Middle East, however eventual. Something hushed, in any case, as it appeared to have no visitors at all.</p><p>There was nothing, on fa�ade or door, to indicate what that might be, no more than there was anything to indicate that Cabinet was Cabinet.</p><p>She'd seen those famously identical, silver-pelted Icelandic twins in the lounge, the first time she'd gone there, both of them drinking red wine from pint glasses, something Inchmale dubbed an Irish affectation. They weren't members, he'd made a point of noting. Cabinet's members, in the performing arts, were somewhat less than stellar, and she assumed that that suited Inchmale just about as well as it suited her.</p><p>It was the decor that had sold Inchmale, he said, and very likely it had been. Both he and it were arguably mad.</p><p>Pushing open the door, through which one might have ridden a horse without having to duck to clear the lintel, she was greeted by Robert, a large and comfortingly chalk-striped young man whose primary task was to mind the entrance without particularly seeming to.</p><p>"Good evening, Miss Henry."</p><p>"Good evening, Robert."</p><p>The decorators had kept it down, here, which was to say that they hadn't really gone publicly, ragingly, batshit insane. There was a huge, ornately carved desk, with something vaguely pornographic going on amid mahogany vines and grape clusters, at which sat one or another of the club's employees, young men for the most part, often wearing tortoiseshell spectacles of the sort she suspected of having been carved from actual turtles.</p><p>Beyond the desk's agreeably archaic mulch of paperwork twined a symmetrically opposed pair of marble stairways, leading to the floor above; that floor being bisected, as was everything above this foyer, into twin realms of presumed philanthropic mystery and Cabinet. From the Cabinet side, now, down the stairs with the wider-shins twist, cascaded the sound of earnest communal drinking, laughter and loud conversation bouncing sharply off unevenly translucent stone, marbled in shades of aged honey, petroleum jelly, and nicotine. The damaged edges of individual steps had been repaired with tidy rectangular inserts of less inspired stuff, pallid and mundane, which she was careful never to step on.</p><p>A tortoise-framed young man, seated at the desk, passed her the room key without being asked.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"You're welcome, Miss Henry."</p><p>Beyond the archway separating the stairways, the floor plan gave evidence of hesitation. Indicating, she guessed, some awkwardness inherent in the halving of the building's original purpose. She pressed a worn but regularly polished brass button, to call down the oldest elevator she'd ever seen, even in London. The size of a small, shallow closet, wider than it was deep, it took its time, descending its elongated cage of black-enameled steel.</p><p>To her right, in shadow, illuminated from within by an Edwardian museum fixture, stood a vitrine displaying taxidermy. Game birds, mostly; a pheasant, several quail, others she couldn't put a name to, all mounted as though caught in motion, crossing a sward of faded billiard-felt. All somewhat the worse for wear, though no more than might be expected for their probable age. Behind them, anthropomorphically upright, forelimbs outstretched in the manner of a cartoon somnambulist, came a moth-eaten ferret. Its teeth, which struck her as unrealistically large, she suspected of being wooden, and painted. Certainly its lips were painted, if not actually rouged, lending it a sinisterly festive air, like someone you'd dread running into at a Christmas party. Inchmale, on first pointing it out to her, had suggested she adopt it as a totem, her spirit beast. He claimed that he already had, subsequently discovering he could magically herniate the disks of unsuspecting music executives at will, causing them to suffer excruciating pain and a profound sense of helplessness.</p><p>The lift arrived. She'd been a guest here long enough to have mastered the intricacies of the articulated steel gate. Resisting an urge to nod to the ferret, she entered and ascended, slowly, to the third floor.</p><p>Here the narrow hallways, walls painted a very dark green, twisted confusingly. The route to her room involved opening several of what she assumed were fire doors, as they were very thick, heavy, and self-closing. The short sections of corridor, between, were hung with small watercolors, landscapes, un-peopled, each one featuring a distant folly. The very <i>same</i> distant folly, she'd noticed, regardless of the scene or region depicted. She refused to give Inchmale the satisfaction he'd derive from her asking about these, so hadn't. Something too thoroughly liminal about them. Best not addressed. Life sufficiently complicated as it was.</p><p>The key, attached to a weighty brass ferrule sprouting thick soft tassels of braided maroon silk, turned smoothly in the lock's brick-sized mass. Admitting her to Number Four, and the concentrated impact of Cabinet's designers' peculiarity, theatrically revealed when she prodded the mother-of-pearl dot set into an otherwise homely gutta-percha button.</p><p>Too tall, somehow, though she imagined that to be the result of a larger room having been divided, however cunningly. The bathroom, she suspected, might actually be larger than the bedroom, if that weren't some illusion.</p><p>They'd run with that tallness, employing a white, custom-printed wallpaper, decorated with ornate cartouches in glossy black. These were comprised, if you looked more closely, of enlarged bits of anatomical drawings of bugs. Scimitar mandibles, spiky elongated limbs, the delicate wings (she imagined) of mayflies. The two largest pieces of furniture in the room were the bed, its massive frame covered entirely in slabs of scrimshawed walrus ivory, with the enormous, staunchly ecclesiastic-looking lower jawbone of a right whale, fastened to the wall at its head, and a birdcage, so large she might have crouched in it herself, suspended from the ceiling. The cage was stacked with books, and fitted, inside, with minimalist Swiss halogen fixtures, each tiny bulb focused on one or another of Number Four's resident artifacts. And not just prop books, Inchmale had proudly pointed out. Fiction or non-, they all seemed to be about England, and so far she'd read parts of Dame Edith Sitwell's <i>English Eccentrics</i> and most of Geoffrey Household's <i>Rogue Male</i>.</p><p>She took off her coat, putting it on a stuffed, satin-covered hanger in the wardrobe, and sat on the edge of the bed to untie her shoes. The Piblokto Madness bed, Inchmale called it. "Intense hysteria," she recited now, from memory, "depression, coprophagia, insensitivity to cold, echolalia." She kicked her shoes in the direction of the wardrobe's open door. "Hold the coprophagia," she added. Cabin fever, this culture-bound, arctic condition. Possibly dietary in origin. Linked to vitamin A toxicity. Inchmale was full of this sort of information, never more so than when he was in the studio. Give Clammy a whole hod of vitamin A, she'd suggested, he looks like he could use it.</p><p>Her gaze fell on three unopened brown cartons, stacked to the left of the wardrobe. These contained shrink-wrapped copies of the British edition of a book she'd written in hotel rooms, though none as peculiarly memorable as this one. She'd begun just after the Chinese car commercial money had come in. She'd gone to Staples, West Hollywood, and bought three flimsy Chinese-made folding tables, to lay the manuscript and its many illustrations out on, in her corner suite at the Marmont. That seemed a long time ago, and she didn't know what she'd do with these copies. The cartons of her copies of the American edition, she now remembered, were still in the luggage room of the Tribeca Grand.</p><p>"Echolalia," she said, and stood, removing her sweater, which she folded and put in a chest-high drawer in the wardrobe, beside a small silk land mine of potpourri. If she didn't touch it, she knew, she wouldn't have to smell it. Putting on an off-white Cabinet robe, more velour than terry but somehow just missing whatever it was that made her so un-fond of velour bathrobes. Men, particularly, looked fundamentally untrustworthy in them.</p><p>The room phone began to ring. It was a collage, its massive nautical-looking handset of rubber-coated bronze resting in a leather-padded cradle atop a cubical box of brass-cornered rosewood. Its ring was mechanical, tiny, as though you were hearing an old-fashioned bicycle bell far off down a quiet street. She stared hard, willing it to silence.</p><p>"Intense hysteria," she said.</p><p>It continued to ring.</p><p>Three steps and her hand was on it.</p><p>It was as absurdly heavy as ever.</p><p>"Coprophagia." Briskly, as if announcing a busy department in a large hospital.</p><p>"Hollis," he said, "hello."</p><p>She looked down at the handset, heavy as an old hammer and nearly as battered. Its thick cord, luxuriously cased in woven burgundy silk, resting against her bare forearm.</p><p>"Hollis?"</p><p>"Hello, Hubertus."</p><p>She pictured herself driving the handset through brittle antique rosewood, crushing the aged electro-mechanical cricket within. Too late now. It had already fallen silent.</p><p>"I saw Reg," he said.</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"I told him to ask you to call."</p><p>"I didn't," she said.</p><p>"Good to hear your voice," he said.</p><p>"It's late."</p><p>"A good night's sleep, then," heartily. "I'll be by in the morning, for breakfast. We're driving back tonight. Pamela and I."</p><p>"Where are you?"</p><p>"Manchester."</p><p>She saw herself taking an early cab to Paddington, the street in front of Cabinet deserted. Catching the Heathrow Express. Flying somewhere. Another phone ringing, in another room. His voice.</p><p>"Manchester?"</p><p>"Norwegian black metal," he said, flatly. She pictured Scandinavian folk jewelry, then self-corrected: the musical genre. "Reg said I might find it interesting."</p><p>Good for him, she thought, Inchmale's subclinical sadism sometimes finding a deserving target.</p><p>"I was planning on sleeping in," she said, if only to be difficult. She knew now that it was going to be impossible to avoid him.</p><p>"Eleven, then," he said. "Looking forward to it."</p><p>"Good night. Hubertus."</p><p>"Good night." He hung up.</p><p>She put the handset down. Careful of the hidden cricket. Not its fault.</p><p>Nor hers.</p><p>Nor even his, probably. Whatever he was.</p><p><br></p><p><b>2. EDGE CITY</b></p><p>Milgrim considered the dog-headed angels in Gay Dolphin Gift Cove.</p><p>Their heads, rendered slightly less than three-quarter scale, appeared to have been cast from the sort of plaster once used to produce worryingly detailed wall-decorations: pirates, Mexicans, turbaned Arabs. There would almost certainly be examples of those here as well, he thought, in the most thoroughgoing trove of roadside American souvenir kitsch he'd ever seen.</p><p>Their bodies, apparently humanoid under white satin and sequins, were long, Modigliani-slender, perilously upright, paws crossed piously in the manner of medieval effigies. Their wings were the wings of Christmas ornaments, writ larger than would suit the average tree.</p><p>They were intended, he decided, with half a dozen of assorted breed facing him now, from behind glass, to sentimentally honor deceased pets.</p><p>Hands in trouser pockets, he quickly swung his gaze to a broader but generally no less peculiar visual complexity, noting as he did a great many items featuring Confederate-flag motifs. Mugs, magnets, ashtrays, statuettes. He considered a knee-high jockey boy, proffering a small round tray rather than the traditional ring. Its head and hands were a startling Martian green (so as not to give the traditional offense, he assumed). There were also energetically artificial orchids, coconuts carved to suggest the features of some generically indigenous race, and prepackaged collections of rocks and minerals. It was like being on the bottom of a Coney Island grab-it game, one in which the eclectically un-grabbed had been accumulating for decades. He looked up, imagining a giant, three-pronged claw, agent of stark removal, but there was only a large and heavily varnished shark, suspended overhead like the fuselage of a small plane.</p><p>How old did a place like this have to be, in America, to have "gay" in its name?

While some form of this rift existed within black politics long before the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., his death&#x2015;and the power vacuum it created&#x2015;heightened tensions between the two groups, and convention leaders sought to merge these competing ideologies into a national, unified call to action. What followed, however, effectively crippled the Black Power movement and fundamentally altered the political strategy of civil rights proponents. An intense and revealing history, Leonard N. Moore&#x2019;s <i>The Defeat of Black Power </i>provides the first in-depth evaluation of this critical moment in American history.</p><p>During the brief but highly charged meeting in March 1972, attendees confronted central questions surrounding black people&#x2019;s involvement in the established political system: reject or accept integration and assimilation; determine the importance or futility of working within the broader white system; and assess the perceived benefits of running for public office. These issues illuminated key differences between integrationists and separatists, yet both sides understood the need to mobilize under a unified platform of black self-determination. At the end of the convention, determined to reach a consensus, officials produced &#x201c;The National Black Political Agenda,&#x201d; which addressed the black constituency&#x2019;s priorities. While attendees and delegates agreed with nearly every provision, integrationists maintained their rejection of certain planks, namely the call for a U.S. constitutional convention and separatists&#x2019; demands for reparations. As a result, black activists and legislators withdrew their support less than ten weeks after the convention, dashing the promise of the 1972 assembly and undermining the prerogatives of black nationalists. </p><p>In <i>The Defeat of Black Power,</i> Moore shows how the convention signaled a turning point for the Black Power movement, whose leaders did not hold elective office and were now effectively barred access to the levers of social and political power. Thereafter, their influence within black communities rapidly declined, leaving civil rights activists and elected officials holding the mantle of black political leadership in 1972 and beyond.</p></p><p>Leonard N. Moore is the George Littlefield Professor of American History at the University of Texas at Austin, and author of <i>Black Rage in New Orleans: Police Brutality and African American Activism from World War II to Hurricane Katrina</i> and <i>Carl B. Stokes and the Rise of Black Political Power.</i>Moore has created an incredibly rich, nuanced, and thoughtful study of the challenges of Black Power in electoral politics. The most thorough exploration of the 1972 National Black Political Convention, this book adds new understanding and insight to a range of historical figures, from Carl Stokes to Floyd McKissick and Shirley Chisholm, who helped forge new political spaces and discourses in debates over black political engagement in the Black Power era.

Genetic counselors and medical geneticists explain the "unexplainable," helping families understand why abnormalities occur and whether they're likely to occur again. <br><br><em>Chromosome Abnormalities and Genetic Counseling</em> is the genetics professional's definitive guide to navigating both chromosome disorders and the clinical questions of the families they impact. Combining a primer on these disorders with the most current approach to their best clinical approaches, this classic text is more than just a reference; it is a guide to how to think about these disorders, even as our technical understanding of them continues to evolve. <br><br>Completely updated and still infused with the warmth and voice that have made it essential reading for professionals across medical genetics, this edition of <em>Chromosome Abnormalities and Genetic Counseling </em>represents a leap forward in clinical understanding and communication.

This is the perfect book for first-year students for so many reasons. It's a story about arriving at a place that you think is awesome but possibly too big for you, judging everyone's outsides against your insides, and finding the power of community, context, and perspective. It's about becoming more aware of how you typically understand (or misunderstand) others--and learning to listen, to tolerate uncertainty, and to try new things (some of which won't work). This is a sensational book that should be everyone's freshman read."--Eve Spangler, PhD, Department of Sociology, Boston College<br><br> "<i>Spark</i> shows how we can think differently yet connect through understanding. Reading about a group of people with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints who come together as the story unfolds is captivating in such a polarizing time.

This novel truly has something for everyone."--Corey P., undergraduate, Fairfield University<br> &nbsp;<br> "This compelling, highly original novel from an internationally renowned sociologist and author brings us to a meeting of people with radically different perspectives and life experiences who are asked to collaboratively answer a question. We eavesdrop on their lively discussions, explore the beauty of Iceland with them, cheer as we see them help each other conquer personal fears, and rejoice as they bond into a caring community. People with very different ideas can learn to learn and care for each other. Kindness matters. We need each other&#x2019;s ways of knowing. <i>Spark</i> is perfect for any group--class, family, community--where differences need to be respected and commonalities affirmed.

Perhaps more fundamentally, it is about the possibility of transcending oneself, seeing people for who they truly are, and thinking beyond disciplinary silos. By freeing the creative imagination from its too-tight borders with the help--and even love--of others, this novel suggests, we can fashion new worlds of meaning and value."--Mark Freeman, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Ethics and Society, College of the Holy Cross<br> &nbsp;<br> "I have often utilized Leavy&#x2019;s books in my graduate social work courses. The characters in her novels expand the thought processes of new social workers on topics related to race, sexuality, and privilege. <i>Spark</i> has surpassed expectations.

Davis, LICSW, Interim Chair, Troy University School of Social Work<br><br> "Delightful and thought provoking, <i>Spark</i> is a compelling read, whether in or out of the classroom.

A diverse cast of characters is brought together to dive into answering one question. Through this process, readers are invited to explore the intellectual terrain of their own assumptions and biases. What is significant about <i>Spark</i> is how it so beautifully brings each character--and reader--to comprehend how we all arrive at answers that truly matter.

Be prepared to have your ideas spark and grow!"--Celeste Snowber, PhD, Faculty of Education, Simon Fraser University, British Columbia, Canada<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In this clever and captivating novel, Leavy shows us how a research project is collaboratively developed from the spark of an idea to research purpose to execution. This is more than a textbook--it is the story of how a group of artists and intellectuals with different skills become a cohesive research team. They must learn how to work with their differences and across research paradigms to see new ways of thinking and to trust in the research process. <i>Spark</i> represents the best of arts-based research from a master of fiction-as-research-method.

Faulkner, PhD, Professor of Communication and Director of Women&#x2019;s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, Bowling Green State University<br> &nbsp;<br> "Leavy, one of the leading voices in arts-based research methods, has penned an engaging novel that illustrates for new scholars the different ways that diverse people come to understand the world--and understand it together. <i>Spark</i> does as its title suggests, kindling readers&#x2019; openness to other people, other ideas, other ways of seeing and being. Modern societies need this skill set more than ever. Through archetypal characters you&#x2019;ll recognize--either in yourself or in people you have met and worked with--and a richly described setting at once alien and familiar, Leavy teaches key research processes that might be used to tackle even seemingly intractable problems. Students will find the novel to be a gentle, entertaining introduction to the research mindset, with vivid characters, dialogue, and scenes that can serve as springboards for deeper, more grounded discussions than those afforded by a traditional textbook. The suggestions for creative writing, classroom use, and research activities provide hours of follow-up opportunities to help turn the novel&#x2019;s spark into a burning excitement for cooperative research."--Marcus B. Weaver-Hightower, PhD, Professor of Educational Foundations and Research, University of North Dakota<br> &nbsp;<br> "A thoroughly enjoyable and thoughtful read! Seven brilliant thinkers from diverse disciplines and countries have just five days to answer a deceptively simple question. This beautifully written novel, set in Iceland&#x2019;s magical landscape, draws readers into a puzzle the group must solve, while simultaneously exploring characters&#x2019; personal struggles. The gradual peeling back of layers, intriguing premise, realistic dialogue, and abundant food for thought make <i>Spark</i> not only a page turner, but also an intellectual treasure that will stick with me."--Christine Sleeter, PhD, author of <i>The Inheritance;</i> Professor Emerita, College of Professional Studies, California State University, Monterey Bay<br><br>"<i>Spark</i> by Patricia Leavy is a buoyant social research novel about collaboration and creativity....<i>Spark</i> is an innovative work of social fiction that offers attentive and relatable insights into the motivations for and challenges of designing and doing research.

It records the joys and pains of budget travel to Kathmandu, India, Afghanistan and other &#x2018;points east&#x2019; in the 1960s and 1970s. Written in a clear, simple style, it provides detailed analysis of the motivations and the experiences of hundreds of thousands of hippies who travelled eastwards. The book is structured around four key debates: were the travellers simply motivated by a search for drugs? Did they encounter love or sexual freedom on the road? Were they basically just tourists? Did they resemble pilgrims? It also considers how the travellers have been represented in films, novels and autobiographical accounts, and will appeal to those interested in the Trail or the 1960s counterculture, as well as students taking courses relating to the 1960s.</p><p>This is the first history of the hippy trail. Based on interviews and self-published works, it records the joys and pains of budget travel out to Kathmandu, India, Afghanistan and other points east during the 1960s and 1970s. Written in a clear, simple style, the book provides a detailed analysis of the motivations and the experiences of the hundreds of thousands of young people who travelled eastwards. The happiness and calm that many found is noted, but the work also has a critical edge, exploring the limitations of the travellers&#39; journeys and the mistakes they made, and discussing the rapidly changing meanings and connotations of the term &#39;hippie&#39;, while setting these themes in the context of 1960s counter-culture.

It traces the connections running from historical events to debates among economists, and from the ideas of academic writers to major experiments in economic policy. The treatment offers fresh perspectives on laissez faire, socialism, and fascism; the Roaring Twenties, business cycle theories, and the Great Depression; Institutionalism and the New Deal; the Keynesian Revolution; and war, nationalization, and central planning. After 1945, the work explores the postwar revival of invisible-hand ideas; economic development and growth, with special attention to contrasting policies and thought in Germany and India; the gold standard, the interwar gold-exchange standard, the postwar Bretton Woods system, and the Great Inflation; public goods and public choice; free trade versus protectionism; and finally fiscal policy and public debt. The investigation analyzes the theories of Adam Smith and earlier writers on economics when those antecedents are useful for readers.</p><p>The Clash of Economic Ideas explains what economists have been disagreeing about for the last hundred years. It covers disputes over the free market, socialism, fascism, the Great Depression, the New Deal, war, nationalization, central planning, economic growth, money and finance, inflation, regulation, free trade, government spending, budget deficits, and public debt. It puts the debates in historical context, and discusses how economic ideas have influenced swings in economic policy. It traces the ideas of modern economists back to their immediate and sometimes distant forerunners to understand the origins of today&#39;s debates.Lawrence H.

The authors provide extensive analysis of the formation of the First Amendment religion clauses and the plausible original intent or understanding of the founders. They describe the enduring principles of American religious freedom--liberty of conscience, free exercise of religion, religious equality, religious pluralism, separation of church and state, and no establishment of religion--as those principles were developed by the founders and applied by the Supreme Court. Successive chapters analyze the two hundred plus Supreme Court cases on religious freedom--on the free exercise of religion, the roles of government and religion in education, the place of religion in public life, and the interaction of religious organizations and the state. A final chapter shows how favorably American religious freedom compares with international human rights norms and European Court of Human Rights case law. <br><br>Lucid, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and balanced, this volume is an ideal classroom text and armchair paperback. Detailed appendices offer drafts of each of the religion clauses debated in 1788 and 1789, a table of all state constitutional laws on religious freedom, and a summary of every Supreme Court case on religious liberty from 1815 to 2015. Throughout the volume, the authors address frankly and fully the hot button issues of our day: religious freedom versus sexual liberty, freedom of conscience and its limitations, religious group rights and the worries about abuse, faith-based legal systems and their place in liberal democracies, and the fresh rise of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Christianity in America and abroad. <br><br>For this new edition, the authors have updated each chapter in light of new scholarship and new Supreme Court case law (through the 2015 term) and have added an appendix mapping some of the cutting edge issues of religious liberty and church-state relations.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Witte, Jr.</strong> is Robert W.

Not only does it explain the theory underlying the properties of the generalized operator, but it also illustrates the wide variety of fields to which these ideas may be applied. Rather than an exhaustive treatment, it represents an introduction that will appeal to a broad spectrum of students. Accordingly, the mathematics is kept as simple as possible.<br>The first of the two-part treatment deals principally with the general properties of differintegral operators. The second half is mainly oriented toward the applications of these properties to mathematical and other problems. Topics include integer order, simple and complex functions, semiderivatives and semi-integrals, and transcendental functions. The text concludes with overviews of applications in the classical calculus and diffusion problems.</p><p>Keith B.

Why do we pay so much more attention to high-powered people than they pay to us? If humans evolved from great apes, why are human selves so much more elaborate? How does our attachment to our parents when we are infants influence the success or failure of our romantic relationships when we are adults? Can behaving morally "license" us to behave immorally shortly afterward? How do social relationships make us more versus less prone toward physical illness? <br><br>This volume -- an update to the original, 2010 edition -- provides a graduate-level introduction to social psychology. The target audience consists of first-year graduate students (MA or PhD) in social psychology and related disciplines (marketing, organizational behavior, etc.), although it is also appropriate for upper-level undergraduate courses. The authors are world-renowned leaders on their topic, and they have written state-of-the-art overviews of the discipline's major research domains. The chapters are not only scientifically rigorous, but also accessible and engaging. They convey the joy, excitement, and promise of scientific investigations into human sociality.<br></p><p><br><strong>Eli J.

Updating a social psychology textbook is an unenviable task at a time of substantial uncertainty about theories and findings that seemed almost ordinary in the last edition. Admirably, Editors Finkel and Baumeister aim to address reproducibility directly in this 2nd Edition of <em>Advanced Social Psychology</em>. The first three chapters discuss replicability challenges and reforms to improve rigor and credibility. They also set the stage that science does not have a canon of inarguable facts. Scientific understanding is always in revision, and every finding, claim, and theory is open to confrontation.<p></p><br>The other 18 substantive chapters approach replicability differently. Some highlight replicability success and challenges in their substantive domains; the chapters on Attraction, Morality, Health, and Computation stand out as effective examples. Others appear to address replicability implicitly by what is not said or cited. In those, the self-corrective process of science is working quietly by omission.

Heinrich Arnold (1913-1982) is best known for his books Discipleship and Freedom from Sinful Thoughts, which have helped thousands to follow Christ in their daily lives, and for his pastoral care as elder of the Bruderhof communities. When Heinrich was seven, his parents Eberhard and Emmy Arnold and their five children left a bourgeois life in Berlin for a dilapidated villa in the German village of Sannerz, where they founded a Christian community based on Jesus&#x2019; teachings in the Sermon on the Mount. As a young man, Heinrich Arnold refused to serve in Hitler's armed forces and was forced to flee Germany. He studied agriculture in Zurich, Switzerland, and in 1936 married Annemarie Waechter, a kindergarten teacher. In 1938 they moved to England, where Heinrich managed the community&#x2019;s farm. In 1941 the community was forced to emigrate to South America. In 1954, Heinrich Arnold and his family moved to the fledgling Woodcrest Bruderhof in Rifton, New York, where he served as pastor for the rest of his life.

Personal and accessible, <i>Dinner at the Long Table</i> brings Tarlow&#x2019;s keen eye for combining design and taste to a collection of seventeen seasonal menus ranging from small gatherings to blow-out celebrations. The menus encompass memorable feasts and informal dinners and include recipes&nbsp;like&nbsp;a leisurely ragu, followed by fruit and biscotti; paella with tomato toasts, and a Catalan custard; fried calamari sandwiches and panzanella; or a lamb tajine with spiced couscous, pickled carrots, and apricots in honey.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Dinner at the Long Table </i>includes family-style meals that have become a tradition in his home. Written with Anna Dunn, the cookbook is organized by occasion and punctuated with personal anecdotes and photography. Much more than just a beautiful cookbook, <i>Dinner at the Long Table</i> is a thematic exploration into cooking, inspiration, and creativity, with a focus on the simple yet innate human practice of preparing and enjoying food together.</p><p>In 1999, ANDREW TARLOW opened his first restaurant, Diner, which serves locally sourced,&nbsp;New American food inside a refurbished 1927 dining car in the industrial neighborhood of South Williamsburg, in Brooklyn. Marlow &amp; Sons, a restaurant, oyster bar, and general store soon followed next door, functioning as a cafe by day and a raw bar and restaurant by night. Other culinary ventures include Marlow &amp; Daughters, a butcher shop specializing in locally sourced grass-fed meat; and Roman's in Fort Greene, an Italian-inspired restaurant. In 2012, Andrew and his partners opened the Wythe Hotel and its ground floor restaurant Reynard in a turn-of-the-century factory building in Williamsburg. He most recently opened Achilles Heel, a riverside watering hole in Greenpoint. He is publisher of <i>Diner Journal</i>, an independent magazine featuring original art, literature, and recipes. Tarlow grew up in New York and began his career as a painter and a bartender at the Odeon. He now lives in Fort Greene with his wife,&nbsp;designer Kate Huling, and their four children.<br> &nbsp;<br> ANNA DUNN has been the editor-in-chief of&nbsp;<i>Diner Journal</i>&nbsp;since its inception in 2006, and a bartender at Diner, Achilles Heel, and Roman&#x2019;s for just as long. She is co-author of the <i>Saltie</i> cookbook and is hard at work on her first crime fiction novel. She lives in Brooklyn.<b>Eggs All Day: An Introduction </b><br> Kate Huling <br> &nbsp;<br> I met Andrew in 1998 at the Odeon, in Tribeca. I was twenty and a new waitress and Andrew was twenty-eight and the senior bartender with a bad attitude and I was crazy for him from minute one. After a month of cheeky banter and snarky flirting, he asked me to come over to his house so that he could cook for me. I put on my red sparkly trousers as a good luck charm and got on the J train to Brooklyn. It was my first trip over the Williamsburg Bridge, and when I got to the other side and walked down the metal staircase, he was there waiting for me, and he kissed me for the first time on the cheek.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He had already bought a skirt steak from Gourmet Garage in the city, and we went into the Korean produce market on Broadway and bought zucchini and cilantro and salad greens. Andrew had built out a six-thousand-square-foot loft on Broadway with his roommates Mark Firth and Martin Cohen. Martin was a mosaicist, and his tile work was all over the open bathrooms. Andrew&#x2019;s paintings were hung on all of the walls. There were great windows looking out at the bridge and Manhattan, and there was a bathtub in the middle of the living area.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew made a cilantro pesto, marinated the skirt steak, tossed the zucchini with peperoncini, and then packed everything up and we climbed out the door onto the roof. He grilled the steak and the zucchini and made a salad, and then everyone started coming onto the roof. Martin and Mark and Sasha and South African Mark. We all sat around an old wooden door propped up on sawhorses and ate and watched the sun set over the city. It was Bastille Day 1998.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mark and Andrew had just signed the lease for the Diner, and I hadn&#x2019;t really spent much time with Mark. I could chart his comings and goings by the presence or absence of stilettos outside his bedroom door, but otherwise, we only saw him when we went to visit him at Balthazar, where he was bartending. I was curious about why Andrew had chosen this reckless Don Juan for a business partner, not knowing that he would very soon become one of my most favorite people.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> They had just gotten the keys to the 1920s Pullman dining car on the corner of Broadway and Berry in Williamsburg. I would have followed Andrew to the ends of the earth, so if he was digging out the layer of fat-cured cockroaches under the dining car&#x2019;s bar and demoing the kitchen, then that is what I wanted to do, too. We spent that summer covered in sweat, grease, and construction dust, so much so that Andrew made a habit of taking an afternoon swim in the East River in his underwear.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> After the demo was done, Andrew, Mark, and their friends Ken Reynolds and Eoin Kileen got to work with the tiling, plumbing, woodworking, and electrical, and even though I was still in college I didn&#x2019;t have much to do. There was nowhere for them to eat lunch on the south side of Williamsburg, so I spent my mornings before class making food for the crew. I hadn&#x2019;t really done much cooking, so I enjoyed teaching myself how to make bread and pastas and roast chickens with Andrew&#x2019;s copies of the <i>River Caf� </i>cookbooks, and they all enjoyed taking a break and coming home to a big lunch.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> As winter approached, it was time to find a chef. I think that it is important to say that Andrew and Mark opened Diner because they wanted a place to eat and hang out, not because they wanted to own a restaurant. They sketched out menus with eggs all day, tuna fish sandwiches, bangers and mash, roast chicken, and pressed cheese sandwiches. They imagined a long line of bridge construction workers eating egg sandwiches at the bar, with themselves sitting at Table 1, playing backgammon and eating ham and cheese. What defines Diner and the food of all of our restaurants today is that stroke of magic that convinced Caroline Fidanza to be our chef after one dinner out with Andrew and Mark. She didn&#x2019;t know us, and we had never tried her food.&nbsp;<br>Caroline had left her post as sous chef for Peter Hoffman at Savoy, and while soul-searching about her next move, she was making the desserts at Teddy&#x2019;s on the north side of the neighborhood. Maybe it was the kind of freedom that Andrew and Mark offered her that made her put her apron back on and become our chef. Maybe it was Andrew&#x2019;s drive or Mark&#x2019;s sense of humor. She signed on, and then we didn&#x2019;t even sit down to cook together or talk about menus. The next time we saw her was when she and I painted the floor of the walk-in refrigerator just days before opening.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On December 31, 1998, we didn&#x2019;t have gas yet or an exhaust, but we knew we needed to get the doors open. Caroline and her sister Jackie arrived at the loft with a giant cassoulet pot, beans, sausages, and confit duck legs, and she prepared the most important meal of our lives, for all of the people who had worked for six months, mostly without pay, to build Diner. There were more than twenty of us and we sat at a very long table in&nbsp;the back room at Diner. Andrew, Mark, and I were at one end of the table. I watched Mark and Andrew take their first bites of Caroline&#x2019;s cassoulet and look at each other as if they had just won the lottery. It will forever be one of my fondest memories. They hadn&#x2019;t any idea of the caliber of the person, and chef, they had found to run their kitchen. In that moment, it became crystal clear that she could make anything happen for them.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caroline had made a giant watercress salad to go with the cassoulet, which was followed by large slices of manchego cheese and quince paste, and then a rum chocolate cake, though we were too full to eat it. We still didn&#x2019;t know Caroline back on that freezing cold night, but after the crowds of people packed the Diner and South African Mark was blasting Radiohead and Jamiroquai and all of our guests were drunk from too many cosmopolitans and metropolitans, Andrew, Mark, and I found ourselves in the kitchen with Caroline, eating the chocolate cake with forks right off the platter. Our lifelong love affair with her began.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> ORIGINAL DINER MENU FROM JANUARY 1999&nbsp;<br> <i>Greek Salad (chopped romaine and herbs)&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Beet Salad (greens with grated raw beets and feta cheese)&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Goat Cheese Salad (greens with marinated goat cheese, roasted squash, and walnuts)&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Roast Chicken with Mash&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Hanger Steak with Mash&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Rib Eye with Fries&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Burger with Fries&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Chocolate Cake with Whipped Cream&nbsp;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Every day after that first day, we woke up at 6 a.m. for garbage pickup and to receive the fish. By day, we worked in the kitchen with Caroline to help her prep. Then at 4 p.m. Andrew, Mark, and I ran down the street to take showers and came back to work the front of the house&#x2014;Mark behind the bar and Andrew and me on the floor. We didn&#x2019;t print out menus. Our menu was recited to the customers and written on the butcher paper of each table so that they could remember it. Caroline quickly felt comfortable running the menu and started making the specials that became the core of Diner&#x2019;s offerings. Her list of specials grew, and the food on the regular menu dwindled.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> What we learned very quickly was that the core of Caroline&#x2019;s cooking is her frugality. She bought local bluefish and mackerel because it was good and cheap. She went to the farmers&#x2019; market instead of ordering from food purveyors because it was better and cheaper; she didn&#x2019;t garnish and she made her own cr�me fra�che and mayonnaise for the same reason. In most cases, plates only had three or four elements. There is a security about her food and what is good. That is how she defines a plate: by whether it&#x2019;s good or not, whether it is in service of the ingredients as well as the season, not whether it will impress you.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her biggest challenge in the early days was that it was impossible to find hardworking, dedicated support in the kitchen. She felt that all of the talent was in Manhattan and that no one wanted to work in our shitty seventy-year-old Diner car underneath the Williamsburg Bridge. So much so that Andrew, Mark, and I continued to have weekly kitchen shifts. I sent out overdressed salads all night, while Mark and Andrew, with blue side towels wrapped around their heads, ditched their garde-manger duties and tried to weasel themselves onto the grill station.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It felt like the Wild West on Broadway in those days. We could do whatever we wanted. If we had a long wait for the outdoor tables, we would just keep adding more of them down Broadway toward the East River. We built a tented room, back behind the dumpsters, with a poorly designed open fireplace and very illegally cooked Sunday dinners, with Caroline and me running a small menu that we had written. It was so smoky back there that we, along with the customers, would finish the night with red eyes and deep coughs, but somehow we still have fond memories of those dinners with overdressed salads (my specialty), crostini, grilled pizzas, and whole fish.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew and I were working hard in those years and didn&#x2019;t do much cooking, eating, or living outside of the Diner, until I got pregnant in 2000 with Elijah. There was still smoking in restaurants, and the Diner dinner service took place in a cloud of smoke from start to finish. Andrew and I stopped cooking in the kitchen and closing the place at 3 a.m. and hired a couple of people. We started cooking and entertaining at home again. We also got to hang out with Caroline outside of work, which was a revelation.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> One night she invited the whole staff over to her house for sauce. We arrived in her Greenpoint apartment to bowls of rigatoni with meatballs, spicy sausage, rich meaty tomato sauce, and a spoonful of ricotta cheese. We all sat on the floor and ate first and then second helpings of the food that she would typically make with her family in Poughkeepsie, New York. Being in her house that night, we all got to see a different side of Caroline, the one that loved cooking and wasn&#x2019;t overwhelmed by her weak kitchen staff and the pressure that Andrew always put on her to do more. This was a night that taught us how important it is to cook for and with everyone beyond the confines of the restaurant.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Elijah was due in the spring of 2001. Inspired by a Greek Easter Meal, the day before his due date I decided that if I cooked a sacrificial lamb over an open fire, Elijah&#x2019;s birth would come the next day as planned. Mark and I drove around the city buying the leg of lamb, snap peas, artichokes, potatoes, and large rosemary fronds for basting. We followed Lulu Peyraud&#x2019;s recipe for leg of lamb roasted on a string over an open fire. We had invited a lot of people over, and since Andrew had wine tastings in the city, Mark and I worked all day in front of that fire, basting the lamb and cooking the potatoes and artichokes under the lamb drippings. When it was time to transport everything down to the house, and my back was breaking and my eyes were skinny slits from all of the smoke, Andrew poked his head around the gates, emerging from the dumpsters, giddy, half drunk and with black teeth from all of the wine and asked if he could help&#x2014;just about eight hours too late.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a good dinner and everyone had fun. I was pretty tired and cleanup wasn&#x2019;t done until around 12:30 a.m. I still remember getting into bed that night aching from head to toe. Four hours later I went into labor with Elijah and he was born the following night at a birthing center in the city. We could only stay for twelve hours, so we slept there a couple of hours, and then packed up to take our tiny son home. On the way through Manhattan, Andrew was convinced that we needed to pick up some food to serve to people who were going to be coming to the house to meet Elijah, so we stopped into Ceci Cela for croissants and went by the restaurant for eggs and bacon. There was a constant trickle of visitors all day, and by nightfall, the house was packed. All of our friends were drinking pink Champagne and smoking cigars in the stairwell, and then at 11:30 p.m., everyone was hungry again. Caroline threw together pasta alla carbonara and we all sat and ate.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Elijah was three, we acquired the lease to the pest management and supply store that was next door to the Diner. Andrew and I had visited a wine bar in Rome and another in Paris that we wanted to reincarnate. Mark had always dreamed of spending his days in a soccer bar, so we thought we&#x2019;d marry the two concepts and were all excited planning and dreaming of our new spot. All of us, except Caroline, who was seriously pissed at Andrew for signing that lease. She was already working every day and unable to attract good cooks, so adding the responsibility of finding and managing another kitchen staff was too much to take.&nbsp;<br><br> When we first opened Marlow &amp; Sons, it was the saddest place on the block. No one wanted to eat oysters and meats and cheeses for dinner, and there weren&#x2019;t enough soccer fans to keep the place full. People would come in, sit down, look at the menu, get up, and walk over to the Diner to eat. We realized that we had to make a decision between turning Marlow &amp; Sons into a bar with no food, or turning it into a restaurant and building a kitchen downstairs. We went for the latter, and in hindsight, it feels like everything changed overnight.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Since I am writing the introduction, I will take this opportunity to take credit for as much as I can. That is part of the deal, right? I had been nagging Andrew about how great our waiter, Jason Schwartz, at the Diner was and kept asking him to promote him to management. Andrew likes to take things slower than I do, so he asked him to come over to Marlow to wait tables, even though it was Loserville over there. Jason believed in Marlow &amp; Sons, and his intrinsic coolness convinced everyone else to believe in it, too. His music, his sense of humor, and his confidence in that place was exactly what Marlow needed. You can&#x2019;t start a fire without a spark, or a Schwartz, as it were.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caroline finally got her prayers answered and kitchen talent started walking through the door. I remember the day in 2005 when Andrew and I were sitting outside at lunch and Sean Rembold jogged up to our table, squatted down in front of us, and accepted the job of sous chef. He was taking such a risk leaving his job working his way up the ranks at Bayard&#x2019;s down on Wall Street, but he was bursting with excitement. I can still remember the burn from the high five he gave us when he decided to come on board.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> At Marlow we had been trying to run a wine bar menu featuring oysters, meats, and cheeses, which apparently wasn&#x2019;t what our customers wanted. Sean had a new and exciting take on what the food at Marlow &amp; Sons could be: fried corn with shrimp butter, rabbit burgers, braised pork over grits with a bright salad on top. Sean&#x2019;s food was exciting: the electric mix of rich and meaty, buttery and fatty, bright and crunchy, and sweet all rolled together in one perfect bite.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;...</p><h2>Butterflies in November</h2><p><b>* Long-listed for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize 2014 *<br><br>"I can&#x2019;t remember the last time I was so enchanted by a novel like I am by <i>Butterflies in November</i>.

Written over a period of 22 years, Planet X represents literally decades of cutting-edge research into the Bible, ancient Near Eastern religion, and both ancient and modern astronomy. Planet X presents powerful and compelling evidence that the most critical events of the Bible &#x2014; the Creation of the heavens and Earth, the birth of Christ, and His Second Coming &#x2014; are all three bound together by the regular re-appearance of a mysterious tenth planet in our solar system. This mysterious planet, dubbed &#x201c;Planet X&#x201d; by modern astronomers who have been searching for it for over a century, is believed by some to be responsible for the creation of Earth in its present form. Planet X presents compelling evidence that this mysterious tenth planet was used by God to not only create the heavens and Earth, but also to herald the birth of Christ as the Star of Bethlehem, and to herald His return in the End-Times as the Sign of the Son of Man and the End of the Age.</p><p>Doug Elwell is the publisher of Mysterious World (www.mysteriousworld.com), an online journal dedicated to travel, history and ancient mysteries of the world.

He lives in New York City.Introduction: From Olympia to London<br> &nbsp;<br> GREEK PATRIOTS MAY look askance at London hosting its third Olympic Games&#x2014;the only world city to do so in modern times, in 1908, 1948, and now 2012&#x2014;while the land of the event&#x2019;s ancient origins has hosted it only twice, in Athens in 1896 and 2004. The more vocal Greek nationalists have described it as an act of historical larceny on a par with the theft of the Elgin Marbles, the sculptures that once graced the Parthenon and now languish in the British Museum. On one level, the resentment is understandable. As this book demonstrates, the classical Games were the greatest emblem of Hellenic culture for nearly eleven centuries, from 776 B.C. to 393 A.D. But the modern revival of the Olympics in 1896, after a 1,500-year hiatus, is not a black-and-white tale of a Greek ritual simply being pilfered. In fact, the nineteenth-century revival might never have occurred without the efforts of the British, particularly a group of eccentric upper-crust Victorians who were obsessed with sports, the classics, and the idealized male form in Greek art.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even in ancient Britain, as a sodden outpost of the Roman Empire from 43&#x2013;410 A.D., Greek-style athletics were not unknown, as the ripples of Hellenic culture infiltrated every corner of Roman rule. Provincial towns such as Bath had their thermae, heated bathing complexes with splendid indoor pools and an attached palaestra for exercising in the revered Greek style. Archaeologists have found that even Roman fortresses in remote locations such as Deva (now the northern town of Chester) had their vast bathhouses for stationed legionnaires, complete with large gymnasiums. Although gladiatorial combats were more popular with the British crowds, fragments of pottery, glass, and mosaics have been discovered depicting Greek athletic events such as discus throwing, wrestling, and boxing. Chariot racing, a key event at the Olympics, was also followed with enthusiasm: In 2004, archaeologists unearthed a stadium in Colchester dating from the third century A.D. At four hundred yards long, it is one of the biggest outside Italy. No large-scale athletics festivals seem to have been organized, as they were in the Mediterranean region. But during the halcyon days of the Pax Romana, when travel around the Empire was safe and comfortable, wealthy nobles from the British Isles journeyed to Rome for study and business. Although records are lacking, we can surmise that some would have traveled on to Olympia, where they could experience the most sacred of all classical festivals.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ancient Olympic Games ended in 393 A.D., when its pagan rituals were no longer tolerated by Christian emperors, and the Roman Empire itself was crumbling under the weight of barbarian invasions. The magnificent shrine where the Games were held, Olympia, was repeatedly sacked, its treasures destroyed, and its location forgotten by all but local peasants. It would not be for another thousand years, during the Renaissance, that Britons would join the European revival of interest in the classical world, and scholars would begin poring once again over rediscovered editions of Homer, Herodotus, and Sophocles. King Henry VIII appointed England&#x2019;s first professors of Greek at Cambridge University in 1540, and at Oxford in 1541. Ancient sagas culled from Plutarch became grist for Shakespeare and other popular playwrights, while Pindar&#x2019;s Olympic odes endowed the name of Olympia with a magical, talismanic ring.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a result, in the 1620s, a certain extravagant, history-loving lawyer named Richard Dover decreed the world&#x2019;s first revived &#x201c;Olympick&#x201d; festival in&#x2014;of all places&#x2014;the green hillsides of the Cotswolds. At the time, Puritans were attacking England&#x2019;s traditional rural festivals for promoting gambling, drinking, and lewd behavior, riddled as they were with pagan relics of fertility rites such as dancing around the Maypole. Dover&#x2019;s Olympicks was an act of defiance against this dour movement, and as an annual event, it began to lure thousands of spectators of all social classes to sit on muddy hillsides near the village of Chipping Campden. A motley range of &#x201c;sports&#x201d; was on the schedule, including hammer throwing, bear baiting, shin kicking, and the brutally violent &#x201c;fighting with cudgels,&#x201d; which left the contestants bloody and toothless (an accidental echo of the most gory of the ancient Greek body contact sports, the pankration). The entire festival was marked by heavy imbibing of ale, and a genial air of license. To his credit, Dover also included a &#x201c;Homeric harpist&#x201d; in an attempt to lift the tone and thus attract the gentry. One English poet in 1636 hailed Dover as &#x201c;an Hero of this our Age.&#x201d; But the exuberant festival could not last. The Cotswald Games were canceled in 1644 due to nearby fighting during the Civil War. Dover died heartbroken six years later.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our modern conception of sport was actually born in Victorian Britain, as the growing middle class repressed the lawless, brutal rural competitions in favor of more civilized and regulated affairs. Teachers at exclusive public schools (that is, fee-paying schools for well-to-do young gentlemen) such as Eton and Rugby began to espouse the radical idea that physical education was crucial for health, moral well-being, team spirit, and general &#x201c;manliness of character.&#x201d; Rules for organized team sports such as football were codified, as were track-and-field events. Europeans and Americans looked on at first in bemusement, then in admiration, as the cult of sports took hold in Victorian society, and seemed to go hand-in-hand with the invincibility of the British Empire.<br> &nbsp;<br> This new passion for exercise dovetailed naturally with the interest in ancient Greece, which grew throughout the nineteenth century to a virtual British obsession. Interest had been rekindled in 1766, when a group of traveling English scholars from the Society of Dilettanti &#x201c;rediscovered&#x201d; the site of ancient Olympia in the Peloponnesus of Greece. By the 1800s, imaginative Oxford and Cambridge dons were idealizing the ancient athletic tradition, and studying Greek statues and vases to revive events like the javelin and discus throw, which had not been practiced for over a millennium.<br> &nbsp;<br> The admiration for the Greek ideal of the male physique was not purely aesthetic. For upper-crust Victorians, conversations about &#x201c;Greek love,&#x201d; of a man for a young boy, allowed the expression of homoerotic desires that were otherwise forbidden. (As historian Linda Dowling has put it, &#x201c;the prestige of ancient Greece ... was so massive that invocations of Hellenism could cast a veil over even a hitherto unmentionable vice or crime.&#x201d;) Sometimes the talk was less ethereal. The Victorian author Frank Harris tells a marvelous story of meeting Oscar Wilde at the Caf� Royal in London, where he was pontificating on the Olympic Games to two Cockney youths he was evidently trying to pick up. &#x201c;Did you say they was naked?&#x201d; one asked, according to Harris. &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Wilde replied, &#x201c;nude, clothed only in sunshine and beauty.&#x201d; When Wilde was prosecuted in 1895 for &#x201c;acts of gross indecency,&#x201d; he mounted a spirited defense of the &#x201c;pure&#x201d; male erotic companionship, citing the celebrated Greek sources he had studied in Dublin and Oxford.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Victorian enthusiasm for sports was accompanied by class-specific distortions. On the scantiest of evidence, scholars espoused the idea that ancient Greek athletes were all &#x201c;amateurs&#x201d; who competed without reward except for wreaths. (In fact, except at the Olympics and three other &#x201c;crown&#x201d; games, the ancients lavished material prizes on the victors, who gained instant celebrity status; even at the Olympics, the material rewards for athletes were enormous once they returned to their home cities.) This conveniently supported the new movement to keep the working classes out of top competitions, so that educated gentlemen could prove that they were superior to the masses in physical achievements as well as (they believed) mind and character. Under the new rules, any athlete who had ever accepted financial reward for training or competing was disqualified from the most prestigious contests, ensuring that sports would be reserved for gilded youth who had the funds and leisure time to train. This cult of amateurism, which was espoused by official organizations like the Amateur Athletics Association, has been denounced by historian David C. Young as &#x201c;a kind of historical hoax&#x201d; twisting ancient Greek texts to maintain an elitist sporting culture.<br> &nbsp;<br> A more democratic development occurred in 1850, when an English country doctor (and devoted classicist) named William Penny Brookes began another version of a revived &#x201c;Olympian Games&#x201d; in a Shropshire village called Much Wenlock. Surrounded by emerald-green hills and attended by country gents, local merchants, and ruddy-faced farmers, the event had the air of a quaint rural carnival&#x2014;although this time more sober than Dover&#x2019;s &#x201c;Olympicks.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s difficult to picture the event today without invoking Monty Python&#x2019;s Flying Circus, for Brookes had a fondness for flamboyant costumes and theatrical rituals. The Olympian Herald wore a cloak and hat with a plume, and announced each competition with a bugle. A key event was the medieval-style &#x201c;tilting at the ring,&#x201d; where horseback riders would try to pierce a ring with a lance. Other competitions were a peculiar mix of the highbrow (foot races, cycling, archery, hurdles, and the pentathlon) to the indulgent (&#x201c;races for old women&#x201d;). Prizes ranged from silver trophies to a pound of fresh tea. From 1860, ten years after its inception, the games at Much Wenlock began a tradition of crowning its victors with a wreath, in homage to ancient tradition. The presenter was usually the local vicar&#x2019;s daughter, who was outfitted less like an ancient Greek sylph than one of Queen Victoria&#x2019;s dowdy nieces, in a heavy bustle dress.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brookes&#x2019;s revived Olympian Games are still held in Shropshire every July, and many relics from the Victorian era, including the herald&#x2019;s uniforms, are on view at the Much Wenlock Museum. In a sense, it is these games that are the seed of our modern Olympics. Not only did imitators of the event spring up around Britain, but Brookes espoused the notion that the Greeks themselves should revive an international version of the Olympics on their own soil. When he learned of a local Olympics being held in Athens in 1859, funded by a Greek businessman named Evangelos Zappos, he sent a Wenlock Cup to be awarded in a long footrace, along with encouragement that the festival should be turned into a much grander event. Brookes repeatedly pressed the idea of an international Olympics upon the Greek minister in London, without success; the Greeks felt that the enterprise would be too expensive for their struggling nation.</p><h2>A Chronological Tour Through the Bible</h2><p><p><b>Travel Straight Through the Events of Scripture</b></p><p>Imagine how your understanding of the Bible could grow if you knew how every part and player fit together on the stage of time! <br><br> Bible scholar Ron Rhodes, author of the popular book The End Times in Chronological Order, now presents a spectacular bird's-eye view of God's larger work&#x2014;past, present, and future.

These were passionate relationships which also had some longevity, except in cases such as that of two young sisters, one of whom was discovered by Joseph&#x2019;s first wife, Emma, in a locked bedroom with the prophet. Emma remained a steadfast opponent of polygamy throughout her life.&nbsp;<br><br>The majority of Smith&#x2019;s wives were younger than he, and one-third were between fourteen and twenty years of age. Another third were already married, and some of the husbands served as witnesses at their own wife&#x2019;s polyandrous wedding. In addition, some of the wives hinted that they bore Smith children&#x2014;most notably Sylvia Sessions&#x2019;s daughter Josephine&#x2014;although the children carried their stepfather&#x2019;s surname.&nbsp;<br><br>For all of Smith&#x2019;s wives, the experience of being secretly married was socially isolating, emotionally draining, and sexually frustrating.&nbsp;Despite the spiritual and temporal benefits, which they acknowledged, they found their faith tested to the limit of its endurance. After Smith&#x2019;s death in 1844, their lives became even more &#x201c;lonely and desolate.&#x201d; One even joined a convent. The majority were appropriated by Smith&#x2019;s successors, based on the Old Testament law of the Levirate, and had children by them, though they considered these guardianships unsatisfying. Others stayed in the Midwest and remarried, while one moved to California. But all considered their lives unhappy, except for the joy they found in their children and grandchildren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Todd M.

My interest, among other things, was Eliza R. Snow&#x2019;s pioneer diaries, housed in the Huntington&#x2019;s impressive document collection. As a leading woman of early Mormonism&#x2014;a poet, female activist, secret polygamous wife to Latter-day Saint (LDS) church founder Joseph Smith, and later a wife of Brigham Young&#x2014;Snow seemed significant enough to warrant further attention, even though much had already been written about her. Particularly interesting to me were her oblique allusions to other plural wives, sometimes referred to by given name, sometimes by maiden or married surname only. To identify these women, I knew I would have to consult reliable lists of the marriages of Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Joseph Smith. Jeffery Johnson had published a good list of Brigham Young&#x2019;s wives, and Stanley Kimball had provided a full list of Heber&#x2019;s. Nevertheless, for Smith himself, I could not find any definitive listing of his plural marriage partners.</p><p>Andrew Jenson&#x2019;s century-old list of twenty-seven of Smith&#x2019;s plural wives provided a core of basic data. In the 1950s, Stanley S. Ivins compiled an unpublished list of eighty-four women, but many of these were only sealings to Joseph after his death. The first fully annotated, footnoted inventory of Smith&#x2019;s plural wives was the appendix of Fawn Brodies&nbsp;<i>No Man Knows My History</i>, published in 1945, with minor updating in the 1971 edition. Although Brodie was a pioneer in documenting Smith&#x2019;s polygamy, fifty years of secondary publications and classification of primary documents have dated her book, and, moreover, scholars have faulted her for relying on antagonistic sources that have since proven unreliable.</p><p>Eventually I concluded that a full, complete, up-to-date list of Joseph Smith&#x2019;s wives would be a valuable addition to Mormon studies, and my project on Eliza Snow metamorphosed into an investigation of all of the wives of Joseph Smith, with Snow being one among many. Since early polygamy was secret and not officially documented, there are still many uncertainties in even a conservative, carefully documented description of Smith&#x2019;s extended family. Nevertheless, this book furthers research on these women, provides an update to Brodie, and attempts a more balanced evaluation than her book offered.</p></p><h2>I&#39;ll Never Let You Go (Morgans of Nashville): 3</h2><p><b>LOVE HURTS</b> <p></p> He promised to kill her.
